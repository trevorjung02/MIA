{"input": " As with previous Valkyira Chronicles games , Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role @-@ playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces . Stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text . The player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked . The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player . Outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs . Alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members . After the game 's completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game . There are also love simulation elements related to the game 's two main heroines , although they take a very minor role . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The game 's battle system , the BliTZ system , is carried over directly from Valkyira Chronicles . During missions , players select each unit using a top @-@ down perspective of the battlefield map : once a character is selected , the player moves the character around the battlefield in third @-@ person . A character can only act once per @-@ turn , but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters ' turns . Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge . Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission . During gameplay , characters will call out if something happens to them , such as their health points ( HP ) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks . Each character has specific \" Potentials \" , skills unique to each character . They are divided into \" Personal Potential \" , which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character , and \" Battle Potentials \" , which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character . To learn Battle Potentials , each character has a unique \" Masters Table \" , a grid @-@ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills . Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield : Kurt can activate \" Direct Command \" and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge , the character Reila can shift into her \" Valkyria Form \" and become invincible , while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " The game takes place during the Second Europan War . Gallian Army Squad 422 , also known as \" The Nameless \" , are a penal military unit composed of criminals , foreign deserters , and military offenders whose real names are erased from the records and thereon officially referred to by numbers . Ordered by the Gallian military to perform the most dangerous missions that the Regular Army and Militia will not do , they are nevertheless up to the task , exemplified by their motto , Altaha Abilia , meaning \" Always Ready . \" The three main characters are No.7 Kurt Irving , an army officer falsely accused of treason who wishes to redeem himself ; Ace No.1 Imca , a female Darcsen heavy weapons specialist who seeks revenge against the Valkyria who destroyed her home ; and No.13 Riela Marcellis , a seemingly jinxed young woman who is unknowingly a descendant of the Valkyria . Together with their fellow squad members , these three are tasked to fight against a mysterious Imperial unit known as Calamity Raven , consisting of mostly Darcsen soldiers . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " As the Nameless officially do not exist , the upper echelons of the Gallian Army exploit the concept of plausible deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make Gallia lose face in the war . While at times this works to their advantage , such as a successful incursion into Imperial territory , other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress . One such member , Gusurg , becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects into the ranks of Calamity Raven , attached to the ideal of Darcsen independence proposed by their leader , Dahau . At the same time , elements within Gallian Army Command move to erase the Nameless in order to protect their own interests . Hounded by both allies and enemies , and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks , the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive while at the same time fight to help the Gallian war effort . This continues until the Nameless 's commanding officer , Ramsey Crowe , who had been kept under house arrest , is escorted to the capital city of Randgriz in order to present evidence exonerating the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor , the Gallian General that had accused Kurt of Treason . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " Concept work for Valkyria Chronicles III began after development finished on Valkyria Chronicles II in early 2010 , with full development beginning shortly after this . The director of Valkyria Chronicles II , Takeshi Ozawa , returned to that role for Valkyria Chronicles III . Development work took approximately one year . After the release of Valkyria Chronicles II , the staff took a look at both the popular response for the game and what they wanted to do next for the series . Like its predecessor , Valkyria Chronicles III was developed for PlayStation Portable : this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for Valkyria Chronicles II , and they had not come up with the \" revolutionary \" idea that would warrant a new entry for the PlayStation 3 . Speaking in an interview , it was stated that the development team considered Valkyria Chronicles III to be the series ' first true sequel : while Valkyria Chronicles II had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move , the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of Valkyria Chronicles II due to being on the same platform . In addition to Sega staff from the previous games , development work was also handled by Media.Vision. The original scenario was written Kazuki Yamanobe , while the script was written by Hiroyuki Fujii , Koichi Majima , Kishiko Miyagi , Seiki Nagakawa and Takayuki Shouji . Its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The majority of material created for previous games , such as the BLiTZ system and the design of maps , was carried over . Alongside this , improvements were made to the game 's graphics and some elements were expanded , such as map layouts , mission structure , and the number of playable units per mission . A part of this upgrade involved creating unique polygon models for each character 's body . In order to achieve this , the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed , as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements . They also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series ' gameplay . The newer systems were decided upon early in development . The character designs were done by Raita Honjou , who had worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games . When creating the Nameless Squad , Honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game : the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality , despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the Valkyria Chronicles world . The main color of the Nameless was black . As with the previous Valkyria games , Valkyria Chronicles III used the CANVAS graphics engine . The anime opening was produced by Production I.G. \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " The music was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto , who had also worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games . When he originally heard about the project , he thought it would be a light tone similar to other Valkyria Chronicles games , but found the themes much darker than expected . An early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected . He redid the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to reassess the game . The main theme was initially recorded using orchestra , then Sakimoto removed elements such as the guitar and bass , then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before redoing segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme . The rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game 's ending . The battle themes were designed around the concept of a \" modern battle \" divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments , constructed to create a sense of atonality . While Sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music , he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar . The guitar was played by Mitsuhiro Ohta , who also arranged several of the later tracks . The game 's opening theme song , \" If You Wish for ... \" ( \u3082\u3057\u3082\u541b\u304c\u9858\u3046\u306e\u306a\u3089 , Moshimo Kimi ga Negauno Nara ) , was sung by Japanese singer May 'n . Its theme was the reason soldiers fought , in particular their wish to protect what was precious to them rather than a sense of responsibility or duty .

Gunsmiths were employed or conscripted , tools purchased or impressed , and the repair of the damaged guns I brought with me and about an equal number found at Little Rock commenced at once . But , after inspecting the work and observing the spirit of the men I decided that a garrison 500 strong could hold out against Fitch and that I would lead the remainder - about 1500 - to Gen 'l Rust as soon as shotguns and rifles could be obtained from Little Rock instead of pikes and lances , with which most of them were armed .

This species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls , which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build .

{"input": " The Gregorian Tower ( Italian : Torre Gregoriana ) or Tower of the Winds ( Italian : Torre dei Venti ) is a round tower located above the Gallery of Maps , which connects the Villa Belvedere with the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City . The tower was built between 1578 and 1580 to a design by the Bolognese architect Ottaviano Mascherino ( who was credited with building the Apostolic Palace ) mainly to promote the study of astronomy for the Gregorian Calendar Reform which was commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII and promulgated in 1582 . It was then also known as the Tower of Winds . The tower is now called the \" Specola Astronomica Vaticana \" , the Vatican Observatory . Four stages of progressive development have occurred since it was first established . The tower was an edifice of great value for astronomical observations made using a sundial as they provided essential confirmation of the need to reform the Julian calendar . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " = = Early history = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The first stage of building of the tower , as recorded by Leo XIII in his motu proprio Ut mysticam of 1891 , is credited to Pope Gregory XIII , Pope from 1572 to 1585 . The directive was to build a tower at a suitable location in the Vatican and equip it with the \" greatest and best instruments of the time \" . The design was effected after a series of meetings of the experts who had been appointed to reform the Julian calendar , in use since 45 BC , to verify their proposed reforms . Fr . Christoph Clavius , a Jesuit mathematician from the Roman College , was the expert on the committee who suggested the new system for the observations . The 73 metres ( 240 ft ) tower was then built above the museum and library , flanked by the Belvedere and della Pigna courtyards . The instrumentation for the observation of the sun rays falling over it consisted of a meridian line designed by Ignazio Danti of Perugia . It was in the form of a circular marble plate in the centre , embellished with scientific designs . The tower still remains today , but has undergone improvements over the centuries . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " = = Second stage = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The second stage of construction in the 17th and 18th centuries , when the tower was under the charge of the Vatican librarian , involved Mgr . Filippo Luigi Gilii , a clergyman of St. Peter 's Basilica . Earlier in 1797 , Pius VI gave approval to placing a Latin inscription Specula Vaticana at the entrance to the upper part of the tower , which was implemented by Cardinal Zelada with plans to enhance the instrumentation system in the tower 's observatory . The original observatory was then set up above the second level of the tower with the agreement of Pope Pius VI . Its instrumentation , apart from many normal devices ( such as meteorological and magnetic equipment , with a seismograph and a small transit and pendulum clock , ) was noted for the Dolland Telescope . The instrumentation facilitated recording of occurrences of eclipse , appearance of comets , Satellites of Jupiter and Mercury \u2019 s transit . As an addition , under the patronage of Pope Pius X , four rotary observatory domes were also added at strategic locations on the 1 @,@ 300 feet ( 400 m ) long fortification walls , more than a thousand years old . Mgr . Gilii , highly respected as a polyglot with a knowledge of physics , biology , archeology and the Hebrew language , was in charge of the observatory from 1800 to 1821 . He carried out continuous meteorological observations ( twice a day at 6 AM and 2 PM ) conforming to the programme of the Mannheim Meteorological Society . While the observation records for seven years were published , the balance data in a manuscript form was preserved in the Vatican Library . Subsequent to Gilii 's death in 1821 , the observatory on the tower was discontinued and the instruments were moved to the observatory at the Roman College . Established in 1787 , it was considered more suitable for making observations than the Vatican . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " = = Third stage = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The revival of the observatory on the Gregorian Tower was initiated by the Barnabite Francesco Denza with the approval of Pope Leo XIII . High quality instruments were procured , partly with generous donations from Hicks of London , and the automatic recording instruments were procured from Richard in Paris . A four @-@ inch equatorial , a three @-@ inch transit instrument , and four pendulum clocks with two chronometers , were also procured from the observatory at Modena . In 1888 , the gift of a 16 inch long telescope to Pope Leo XIII , became a part of the observatory . Father Denza joined the observatory in 1889 after it was upgraded with more modern instruments . The same year , a second tower was built some 400 metres ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) away from the main Gregorian Tower , overlooking the Vatican Gardens behind St. Peter 's Basilica on the south @-@ west border . It was built to a diameter of 17 metres ( 56 ft ) with a lower wall thickness of 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) , which could bear the load of a 13 inch photographic refractor , newly procured from Paris . Augustinian Father Rodriguez was the expert meteorologist who held the post of director from 1898 to 1905 . In 1891 , Pope Leo XIII , promulgating the motu proprio Ut mysticam , designated the second tower as the seat of the newly established Vatican Observatory , a decision which required altering the roof to provide a flat terrace for astronomical observations . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " = = Fourth stage = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The fourth stage involved remedying the problem of communicating between the two towers during the time of Pope Pius X. His plans were to make the Gregorian Tower into a historical tower and to record and carry out observations at the second tower by linking the two towers along the fortified wall with a 83 metres ( 272 ft ) iron bridge spanning the gap . At the west end of this bridge , a four @-@ inch equatorial was installed on semicircular bastion . The east end of the bridge , above the barracks of the gendarmes , had a heliograph , with a camera attached , used to photograph the Sun ( photoheliograph ) . A new 16 @-@ inch visual telescope , called Torre Pio X , was erected in the second tower . As a result of these modifications , the original library was moved to the Pontifical Academy Lincei , and the old meteorological and seismic instruments were shifted to the Valle di Pompei observatory . The new Astronomical Library was housed in two rooms of the building . The two new Repsold machines were used for recording on the astrographic plates .

These were created by Ignazio Danti , the papal cosmographer , in association with the Gregorian Calendar Reform . The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north @-@ south direction , intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year . The observations made with the sundial provided essential confirmation of the need to reform the Julian calendar . The anemoscope , in contrast , was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning .

To disguise his control of Fingal , and the destination of her cargo , Bulloch hired an English crew and captain and put out his destination as Bermuda and Nassau in the Bahamas . The cargo was loaded in Greenock in early October , although Bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at Holyhead , Wales .

He planned to make another attempt on the next full tide , rejecting Mallory 's idea that he wait until the nearly complete ironclad Savannah was finished before his next sortie . In the meantime , Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont , commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron , had ordered the monitors Weehawken and Nahant into Wassaw Sound . Commander John Rodgers in Weehawken had overall command of the two ships . \n", "label": 1}

Webb planned to sink one of the monitors with his spar torpedo and then deal with the other one with his guns . The gunboat Isondiga and the tugboat Resolute were to accompany him to tow one or both of the monitors back to Savannah . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " A lookout aboard Weehawken spotted Atlanta at 04 : 10 on the morning of 17 June . When the latter ship closed to within about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) of the two Union ships , she fired one round from her bow gun that passed over Weehawken and landed near Nahant . Shortly afterward , Atlanta ran aground on a sandbar ; she was briefly able to free herself , but the pressure of the tide pushed her back onto the sandbar . This time Webb was unable to get off and the monitors closed the range . When Weehawken , the leading ship , closed to within 200 \u2013 300 yards ( 180 \u2013 270 m ) she opened fire with both of her guns . The 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) shell missed , but the 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) shell struck the ironclad above the port middle gun port , penetrated her armor and broke the wooden backing behind it , spraying splinters and fragments that disabled the entire gun crew and half the crew of the bow gun , even though it failed to cleanly penetrate through the backing . The next shot from the 11 @-@ inch Dahlgren gun struck the upper hull and started a small leak even though it failed to penetrate the two @-@ inch armor there . The next shell from the 15 @-@ inch Dahlgren glanced off the middle starboard gun shutter as it was being opened , wounding half the gun 's crew with fragments . The final shell was also from the 15 @-@ inch Dahlgren and it struck the top of the pilothouse , breaking the armor there and wounding both pilots in it . By this time , Atlanta had been able to fire only seven shots , none of which hit either Union ship , and was hard aground with high tide not due for another hour and a half . Weehawken and Nahant were able to freely maneuver into positions from which the Atlanta 's narrow gun ports would not allow her to reply and the damage already inflicted by the former ship made further resistance futile . Webb surrendered his ship within 15 minutes of opening fire , before Nahant even had a chance to fire . Of the ironclad 's 21 officers and 124 enlisted men , one man was killed and another sixteen were wounded badly enough to require hospitalization . \n", "label": 1}

The beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion , which emerged sometime in prehistory . Deities represented natural forces and phenomena , and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat , or divine order . After the founding of the Egyptian state around 3100 BC , the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh , who claimed to be the gods ' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " In different eras , various gods were said to hold the highest position in divine society , including the solar deity Ra , the mysterious god Amun , and the mother goddess Isis . The highest deity was usually credited with the creation of the world and often connected with the life @-@ giving power of the sun . Some scholars have argued , based in part on Egyptian writings , that the Egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities . Yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of the world , except possibly during the era of Atenism in the 14th century BC , when official religion focused exclusively on the impersonal sun god Aten . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " The beings in ancient Egyptian tradition who might be labeled as deities are difficult to count .

{"input": " The Egyptian language 's terms for these beings were n\u1e6fr , \" god \" , and its feminine form n\u1e6frt , \" goddess \" . Scholars have tried to discern the original nature of the gods by proposing etymologies for these words , but none of these suggestions has gained acceptance , and the terms ' origin remains obscure . The hieroglyphs that were used as ideograms and determinatives in writing these words show some of the traits that the Egyptians connected with divinity . The most common of these signs is a flag flying from a pole . Similar objects were placed at the entrances of temples , representing the presence of a deity , throughout ancient Egyptian history . Other such hieroglyphs include a falcon , reminiscent of several early gods who were depicted as falcons , and a seated male or female deity . The feminine form could also be written with an egg as determinative , connecting goddesses with creation and birth , or with a cobra , reflecting the use of the cobra to depict many female deities . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The Egyptians distinguished n\u1e6frw , \" gods \" , from rm\u1e6f , \" people \" , but the meanings of the Egyptian and the English terms do not match perfectly . The term n\u1e6fr may have applied to any being that was in some way outside the sphere of everyday life . Deceased humans were called n\u1e6fr because they were considered to be like the gods , whereas the term was rarely applied to many of Egypt 's lesser supernatural beings , which modern scholars often call \" demons \" . Egyptian religious art also depicts places , objects , and concepts in human form . These personified ideas range from deities that were important in myth and ritual to obscure beings , only mentioned once or twice , that may be little more than metaphors . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Confronting these blurred distinctions between gods and other beings , scholars have proposed various definitions of a \" deity \" . One widely accepted definition , suggested by Jan Assmann , says that a deity has a cult , is involved in some aspect of the universe , and is described in mythology or other forms of written tradition . According to a different definition , by Dimitri Meeks , n\u1e6fr applied to any being that was the focus of ritual . From this perspective , \" gods \" included the king , who was called a god after his coronation rites , and deceased souls , who entered the divine realm through funeral ceremonies . Likewise , the preeminence of the great gods was maintained by the ritual devotion that was performed for them across Egypt . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " = = Origins = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The first written evidence of deities in Egypt comes from the Early Dynastic Period ( c . 3100 \u2013 2686 BC ) . Deities must have emerged sometime in the preceding Predynastic Period ( before 3100 BC ) and grown out of prehistoric religious beliefs . Predynastic artwork depicts a variety of animal and human figures . Some of these images , such as stars and cattle , are reminiscent of important features of Egyptian religion in later times , but in most cases there is not enough evidence to say whether the images are connected with deities . As Egyptian society grew more sophisticated , clearer signs of religious activity appeared . The earliest known temples appeared in the last centuries of the predynastic era , along with images that resemble the iconographies of known deities : the falcon that represents Horus and several other gods , the crossed arrows that stand for Neith , and the enigmatic \" Set animal \" that represents Set . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Many Egyptologists and anthropologists have suggested theories about how the gods developed in these early times . Gustave J\u00e9quier , for instance , thought the Egyptians first revered primitive fetishes , then deities in animal form , and finally deities in human form , whereas Henri Frankfort argued that the gods must have been envisioned in human form from the beginning . Some of these theories are now regarded as too simplistic , and more current ones , such as Siegfried Morenz ' hypothesis that deities emerged as humans began to distinguish themselves from and personify their environment , are difficult to prove . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Predynastic Egypt originally consisted of small , independent villages . Because many deities in later times were strongly tied to particular towns and regions , many scholars have suggested that the pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states , spreading and intermingling the worship of the old local deities . But others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were , like other elements of Egyptian culture , present all across the country despite the political divisions within it . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The final step in the formation of Egyptian religion was the unification of Egypt , in which rulers from Upper Egypt made themselves pharaohs of the entire country . These sacred kings and their subordinates assumed the exclusive right to interact with the gods , and kingship became the unifying focus of the religion . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " New gods continued to emerge after this transformation . Some important deities like Isis and Amun are not known to have appeared until the Old Kingdom ( c . 2686 \u2013 2181 BC ) . Places and concepts could suddenly inspire the creation of a deity to represent them , and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite @-@ sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses . Kings were said to be divine , although only a few continued to be worshipped long after their deaths . Some non @-@ royal humans were said to have the favor of the gods and were venerated accordingly . This veneration was usually short @-@ lived , but the court architects Imhotep and Amenhotep son of Hapu were regarded as gods centuries after their lifetimes , as were some other officials . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Through contact with neighboring civilizations , the Egyptians also adopted foreign deities .

In Greek and Roman times , from 332 BC to the early centuries AD , deities from across the Mediterranean world were revered in Egypt , but the native gods remained , and they often absorbed the cults of these newcomers into their own worship . \n", "label": 1}

The populace may , for example , have mistaken the religion 's symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth .

{"input": " = = = Roles = = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Most Egyptian deities represent natural or social phenomena . The gods were generally said to be immanent in these phenomena \u2014 to be present within nature . The types of phenomena they represented include physical places and objects as well as abstract concepts and forces . The god Shu was the deification of all the world 's air ; the goddess Meretseger oversaw a limited region of the earth , the Theban Necropolis ; and the god Sia personified the abstract notion of perception . Major gods often had many roles and were involved in several types of phenomena . For instance , Khnum was the god of Elephantine Island in the midst of the Nile , the river that was essential to Egyptian civilization . He was credited with producing the annual Nile flood that fertilized the nation 's farmland . Perhaps as an outgrowth of this life @-@ giving function , he was said to create all living things , fashioning their bodies on a potter 's wheel . Gods could share the same role in nature ; Ra , Atum , Khepri , Horus , and other deities acted as sun gods . Despite their diverse functions , most gods had an overarching role in common : maintaining maat , the universal order that was a central principle of Egyptian religion and was itself personified as a goddess . But some deities represented disruption to maat . Most prominently , Apep was the force of chaos , constantly threatening to annihilate the order of the universe , and Set was an ambivalent member of divine society who could both fight disorder and foment it . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Not all aspects of existence were seen as deities . Although many deities were connected with the Nile , no god personified it in the way that Ra personified the sun . Short @-@ lived phenomena , like rainbows or eclipses , were not represented by gods ; neither were elements like fire and water or many other components of the world . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The roles of each deity were fluid , and each god could expand its nature to take on new characteristics . As a result , gods ' roles are difficult to categorize or define . But despite their flexibility , the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence . Not even the creator god could reach beyond the boundaries of the cosmos that he created , and even Isis , though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods , was not omniscient . Richard H. Wilkinson , however , argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that , as beliefs about the god Amun evolved , he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The deities with the most limited and specialized domains are often called \" minor divinities \" or \" demons \" in modern writing , although there is no firm definition for these terms . Among these lesser deities , Egyptologist Claude Traunecker draws a distinction between \" genies \" \u2014 specialized patron spirits of certain places , objects , or activities , such as the sea or marsh god Wadj @-@ Wer and the harvest goddess Renenutet \u2014 and demons , who have a more dangerous character . Many demons are hostile , causing illness and other troubles among humans . Their power can also be protective ; they may guard certain places in the Duat , the realm of the dead , or advise and watch over humans . Egyptians believed the landscape was full of these unpredictable divine powers . Demons often act as servants and messengers to the greater gods , but their position in the hierarchy is not fixed . The protective deities Bes and Taweret originally had minor , demon @-@ like roles , but over time they came to be credited with great influence . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " Divine behavior was believed to govern all of nature . Except for the few deities who disrupted the divine order , the gods ' actions maintained maat and created and sustained all living things .

Heka was a fundamental power that the creator god used to form the world and the gods themselves . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The gods ' actions in the present are described and praised in hymns and funerary texts . In contrast , mythology mainly concerns the gods ' actions during a vaguely imagined past in which the gods were present on earth and interacted directly with humans . The events of this past time set the pattern for the events of the present . Periodic occurrences were tied to events in the mythic past ; the succession of each new pharaoh , for instance , reenacted Horus ' accession to the throne of his father Osiris . Myths are metaphors for the gods ' actions , which humans cannot fully understand . They contain seemingly contradictory ideas , each expressing a particular perspective on divine events . The contradictions in myth are part of the Egyptians ' many @-@ faceted approach to religious belief \u2014 what Henri Frankfort called a \" multiplicity of approaches \" to understanding the gods . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " In myth , the gods behave much like humans . They feel emotion ; they can eat , drink , fight , weep , sicken , and die . Some have unique character traits . Set is aggressive and impulsive , and Thoth , patron of writing and knowledge , is prone to long @-@ winded speeches . Yet overall , the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters . Their behavior is inconsistent , and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated . Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots , because the symbolic meaning of the myths was more important than elaborate storytelling . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The first divine act is the creation of the cosmos , described in several creation myths . They focus on different gods , each of which may act as creator deities . The eight gods of the Ogdoad , who represent the chaos that precedes creation , give birth to the sun god , who establishes order in the newly formed world ; Ptah , who embodies thought and creativity , gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them ; Atum produces all things as emanations of himself ; and Amun , according to the myths promoted by his priesthood , preceded and created the other creator gods . These and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory . Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos . The period following creation , in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society , is the setting for most myths . The gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " A recurring theme in these myths is the effort of the gods to maintain maat against the forces of disorder . They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation . Ra and Apep , battling each other each night , continue this struggle into the present . Another prominent theme is the gods ' death and revival . The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris ' murder , in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat . The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky , sink into the Duat at night , and emerge as a young child at dawn . In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of primordial chaos . Funerary texts that depict Ra 's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him . Instead of being changelessly immortal , the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation , thus renewing the whole world . But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return . Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen \u2014 that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world , leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " Gods were linked with specific regions of the universe . In Egyptian tradition , the world includes the earth , the sky , and the Duat . Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation . The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky , although gods whose roles were linked with other parts of the universe were said to live in those places instead . Most events of mythology , set in a time before the gods ' withdrawal from the human realm , take place in an earthly setting . The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky . The Duat , in contrast , is treated as a remote and inaccessible place , and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those in the world of the living . The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant . It too is inhabited by deities , some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " In the time after myth , most gods were said to be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world . Temples were their main means of contact with humanity . Each day , it was believed , the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples , their homes in the human world . There they inhabited the cult images , the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals . This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth . As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities , the god in a city 's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region . Deities ' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over . Many gods had more than one cult center , and their local ties changed over time . They could establish themselves in new cities , or their range of influence could contract . Therefore , a given deity 's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin . The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity . When kings from Thebes took control of the country at start of the Middle Kingdom ( c . 2055 \u2013 1650 BC ) , they elevated Thebes ' patron gods \u2014 first the war god Montu and then Amun \u2014 to national prominence . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " In Egyptian belief , names express the fundamental nature of the things to which they refer . In keeping with this belief , the names of deities often relate to their roles or origins .

But many other names have no certain meaning , even when the gods who bear them are closely tied to a single role . The names of the sky goddess Nut and the earth god Geb do not resemble the Egyptian terms for sky and earth . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The Egyptians also devised false etymologies giving more meanings to divine names . A passage in the Coffin Texts renders the name of the funerary god Sokar as sk r , meaning \" cleaning of the mouth \" , to link his name with his role in the Opening of the Mouth ritual , while one in the Pyramid Texts says the name is based on words shouted by Osiris , connecting Sokar with the most important funerary deity . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The gods were believed to have many names . Among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others . To know the true name of a deity was to have power over it . The importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which Isis poisons the superior god Ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her . Upon learning the name , she tells it to her son , Horus , and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " In addition to their names , gods were given epithets , like \" possessor of splendor \" , \" ruler of Abydos \" , or \" lord of the sky \" , that describe some aspect of their roles or their worship . Because of the gods ' multiple and overlapping roles , deities can have many epithets \u2014 with more important gods accumulating more titles \u2014 and the same epithet can apply to many deities . Some epithets eventually became separate deities , as with Werethekau , an epithet applied to several goddesses meaning \" great enchantress \" , which came to be treated as an independent goddess .

{"input": " = = = Relationships = = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Egyptian deities are connected in a complex and shifting array of relationships . A god 's connections and interactions with other deities helped define its character .

{"input": " Family relationships are a common type of connection between gods . Deities often form male and female pairs , reflecting the importance of procreation in Egyptian religious thought . Families of three deities , with a father , mother , and child , represent the creation of new life and the succession of the father by the child , a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession . Osiris , Isis , and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type . The pattern they set grew more widespread over time , so that many deities in local cult centers , like Ptah , Sekhmet , and their child Nefertum at Memphis and Amun , Mut , and Khonsu at Thebes , were assembled into family triads . Genealogical connections like these are changeable , in keeping with the multiple perspectives in Egyptian belief . Hathor , as a fertility goddess , could act as mother to any child god , including the child form of the sun god , although in other circumstances she was the sun god 's daughter . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Other divine groups were composed of deities with interrelated roles , or who together represented a region of the Egyptian mythological cosmos . There were sets of gods for the hours of the day and night and for each nome ( province ) of Egypt . Some of these groups contain a specific , symbolically important number of deities . Paired gods can stand for opposite but interrelated concepts that are part of a greater unity . Ra , who is dynamic and light @-@ producing , and Osiris , who is static and shrouded in darkness , merge into a single god each night . Groups of three are linked with plurality in ancient Egyptian thought , and groups of four connote completeness . Rulers in the late New Kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others : Amun , Ra , and Ptah . These deities stood for the plurality of all gods , as well as for their own cult centers ( the major cities of Thebes , Heliopolis , and Memphis ) and for many threefold sets of concepts in Egyptian religious thought . Sometimes Set , the patron god of the Nineteenth Dynasty kings and the embodiment of disorder within the world , was added to this group , which emphasized a single coherent vision of the pantheon . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Nine , the product of three and three , represents a multitude , so the Egyptians called several large groups \" enneads \" , or sets of nine , even if they had more than nine members . The most prominent ennead was the Ennead of Heliopolis , an extended family of deities descended from the creator god Atum , which incorporates many important gods . The term \" ennead \" was often extended to include all of Egypt 's deities . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " This divine assemblage had a vague and changeable hierarchy . Gods with broad influence in the cosmos or who were mythologically older than others had higher positions in divine society . At the apex of this society was the king of the gods , who was usually identified with the creator deity . In different periods of Egyptian history , different gods were most frequently said to hold this exalted position . Horus was the most important god in the Early Dynastic Period , Ra rose to preeminence in the Old Kingdom , Amun was supreme in the New , and in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods , Isis was the divine queen and creator goddess . Newly prominent gods tended to adopt characteristics from their predecessors . Isis absorbed the traits of many other goddesses during her rise , and when Amun became the ruler of the pantheon , he was conjoined with Ra , the traditional king of the gods , to become a solar deity . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " = = = Manifestations and combinations = = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The gods were believed to manifest in many forms . The Egyptians had complex conception of the human soul , consisting of several parts . The spirits of the gods were composed of many of these same elements . The ba was the component of the human or divine soul that affected the world around it . Any visible manifestation of a god 's power could be called its ba ; thus , the sun was called the ba of Ra . A depiction of a deity was considered a ka , another component of its being , which acted as a vessel for that deity 's ba to inhabit . The cult images of gods that were the focus of temple rituals , as well as the sacred animals that represented certain deities , were believed to house divine bas in this way . Gods could be ascribed many bas and kas , which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of the god 's nature . Everything in existence was said to be one of the kas of Atum the creator god , who originally contained all things within himself , and one deity could be called the ba of another , meaning that the first god is a manifestation of the other 's power . Divine body parts could act as separate deities , like the Eye of Ra and Hand of Atum , both of which were personified as goddesses . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Nationally important deities gave rise to local manifestations , which sometimes absorbed the characteristics of older regional gods . Horus had many forms tied to particular places , including Horus of Nekhen , Horus of Buhen , and Horus of Edfu . Such local manifestations could be treated almost as separate beings . During the New Kingdom , one man was accused of stealing clothes by an oracle supposed to communicate messages from Amun of Pe @-@ Khenty . He consulted two other local oracles of Amun hoping for a different judgment . Gods ' manifestations also differed according to their roles . Horus could be a powerful sky god or vulnerable child , and these forms were sometimes counted as independent deities . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Gods were combined with each other as easily as they were divided . A god could be called the ba of another , or two or more deities could be joined into one god with a combined name and iconography . Local gods were linked with greater ones , and deities with similar functions were combined . Ra was connected with the local deity Sobek to form Sobek @-@ Ra ; with his fellow ruling god , Amun , to form Amun @-@ Ra ; with the solar form of Horus to form Ra @-@ Horakhty ; and with several solar deities as Horemakhet @-@ Khepri @-@ Ra @-@ Atum . On rare occasion , even deities of different sexes were joined in this way , producing combinations like Osiris @-@ Neith and Mut @-@ Min . This linking of deities is called syncretism . Unlike other situations for which this term is used , the Egyptian practice was not meant to fuse competing belief systems , although foreign deities could be syncretized with native ones . Instead , syncretism acknowledged the overlap between their roles , and extended the sphere of influence for each of them . Syncretic combinations were not permanent ; a god who was involved in one combination continued to appear separately and to form new combinations with other deities . But closely connected deities did sometimes merge . Horus absorbed several falcon gods from various regions , such as Khenty @-@ irty and Khenty @-@ khety , who became little more than local manifestations of him ; Hathor subsumed a similar cow goddess , Bat ; and an early funerary god , Khenti @-@ Amentiu , was supplanted by Osiris and Anubis . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " In the reign of Akhenaten ( c . 1353 \u2013 1336 BC ) in the mid @-@ New Kingdom , a single solar deity , the Aten , became the sole focus of the state religion . Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased the gods ' names and images on monuments , targeting Amun in particular . This new religious system , sometimes called Atenism , differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods . Whereas , in earlier times , newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs , Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives . Yet Atenism may not have been full monotheism , which totally excludes belief in other deities . There is evidence suggesting that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private . The picture is further complicated by Atenism 's apparent tolerance for some other deities , like Shu . For these reasons , the Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat suggested that Akhenaten may have been monolatrous , worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others . In any case , Atenism 's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace , and Akhenaten 's successors returned to traditional beliefs . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " = = = Unity of the divine in traditional religion = = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Scholars have long debated whether traditional Egyptian religion ever asserted that the multiple gods were , on a deeper level , unified . Reasons for this debate include the practice of syncretism , which might suggest that all the separate gods could ultimately merge into one , and the tendency of Egyptian texts to credit a particular god with power that surpasses all other deities . Another point of contention is the appearance of the word \" god \" in wisdom literature , where the term does not refer to a specific deity or group of deities . In the early 20th century , for instance , E. A. Wallis Budge believed that Egyptian commoners were polytheistic , but knowledge of the true monotheistic nature of the religion was reserved for the elite , who wrote the wisdom literature . His contemporary James Henry Breasted thought Egyptian religion was instead pantheistic , with the power of the sun god present in all other gods , while Hermann Junker argued that Egyptian civilization had been originally monotheistic and became polytheistic in the course of its history . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " In 1971 , Erik Hornung published a study rebutting these views . He points out that in any given period many deities , even minor ones , were described as superior to all others . He also argues that the unspecified \" god \" in the wisdom texts is a generic term for whichever deity the reader chooses to revere . Although the combinations , manifestations , and iconographies of each god were constantly shifting , they were always restricted to a finite number of forms , never becoming fully interchangeable in a monotheistic or pantheistic way . Henotheism , Hornung says , describes Egyptian religion better than other labels . An Egyptian could worship any deity at a particular time and credit it with supreme power in that moment , without denying the other gods or merging them all with the god that he or she focused on . Hornung concludes that the gods were fully unified only in myth , at the time before creation , after which the multitude of gods emerged from a uniform nonexistence . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Hornung 's arguments have greatly influenced other scholars of Egyptian religion , but some still believe that at times the gods were more unified than he allows . Jan Assmann maintains that the notion of a single deity developed slowly through the New Kingdom , beginning with a focus on Amun @-@ Ra as the all @-@ important sun god . In his view , Atenism was an extreme outgrowth of this trend . It equated the single deity with the sun and dismissed all other gods . Then , in the backlash against Atenism , priestly theologians described the universal god in a different way , one that coexisted with traditional polytheism . The one god was believed to transcend the world and all the other deities , while at the same time , the multiple gods were aspects of the one . According to Assmann , this one god was especially equated with Amun , the dominant god in the late New Kingdom , whereas for the rest of Egyptian history the universal deity could be identified with many other gods . James P. Allen says that coexisting notions of one god and many gods would fit well with the \" multiplicity of approaches \" in Egyptian thought , as well as with the henotheistic practice of ordinary worshippers . He says that the Egyptians may have recognized the unity of the divine by \" identifying their uniform notion of ' god ' with a particular god , depending on the particular situation . \" \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " = = Descriptions and depictions = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Egyptian writings describe the gods ' bodies in detail . They are made of precious materials ; their flesh is gold , their bones are silver , and their hair is lapis lazuli . They give off a scent that the Egyptians likened to the incense used in rituals . Some texts give precise descriptions of particular deities , including their height and eye color . Yet these characteristics are not fixed ; in myths , gods change their appearances to suit their own purposes . Egyptian texts often refer to deities ' true , underlying forms as \" mysterious \" . The Egyptians ' visual representations of their gods are therefore not literal . They symbolize specific aspects of each deity 's character , functioning much like the ideograms in hieroglyphic writing . For this reason , the funerary god Anubis is commonly shown in Egyptian art as a dog or jackal , a creature whose scavenging habits threaten the preservation of buried mummies , in an effort to counter this threat and employ it for protection . His black coloring alludes to the color of mummified flesh and to the fertile black soil that Egyptians saw as a symbol of resurrection . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Most gods were depicted in several ways . Hathor could be a cow , cobra , lioness , or a woman with bovine horns or ears . By depicting a given god in different ways , the Egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature . The gods are depicted in a finite number of these symbolic forms , so that deities can often be distinguished from one another by their iconographies . These forms include men and women ( anthropomorphism ) , animals ( zoomorphism ) , and , more rarely , inanimate objects . Combinations of forms , such as gods with human bodies and animal heads , are common . New forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history . Some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are labeled in writing , as with Isis and Hathor . Because of the close connection between these goddesses , they could both wear the cow @-@ horn headdress that was originally Hathor 's alone . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Certain features of divine images are more useful than others in determining a god 's identity . The head of a given divine image is particularly significant . In a hybrid image , the head represents the original form of the being depicted , so that , as the Egyptologist Henry Fischer put it , \" a lion @-@ headed goddess is a lion @-@ goddess in human form , while a royal sphinx , conversely , is a man who has assumed the form of a lion . \" Divine headdresses , which range from the same types of crowns used by human kings to large hieroglyphs worn on gods ' heads , are another important indicator . In contrast , the objects held in gods ' hands tend to be generic . Male deities hold was staffs , goddesses hold stalks of papyrus , and both sexes carry ankh signs , representing the Egyptian word for \" life \" , to symbolize their life @-@ giving power . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The forms in which the gods are shown , although diverse , are limited in many ways . Many creatures that are widespread in Egypt were never used in divine iconography , whereas a few , such as falcons , cobras , and cattle , can each represent many deities . Animals that were absent from Egypt in the early stages of its history were not used as divine images . For instance , the horse , which was only introduced in the Second Intermediate Period ( c . 1650 \u2013 1550 BC ) , never represented a god . Similarly , the clothes worn by anthropomorphic deities in all periods changed little from the styles used in the Old Kingdom : a kilt , false beard , and often a shirt for male gods and a long , tight @-@ fitting dress for goddesses . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The basic anthropomorphic form varies . Child gods are depicted nude , as are some adult gods when their procreative powers are emphasized . Certain male deities are given heavy bellies and breasts , signifying either androgyny or prosperity and abundance . Whereas most male gods have red skin and most goddesses are yellow \u2014 the same colors used to depict Egyptian men and women \u2014 some are given unusual , symbolic skin colors . Thus the blue skin and paunchy figure of the god Hapi alludes to the Nile flood he represents and the nourishing fertility it brought . A few deities , such as Osiris , Ptah , and Min , have a \" mummiform \" appearance , with their limbs tightly swathed in cloth . Although these gods resemble mummies , the earliest examples predate the cloth @-@ wrapped style of mummification , and this form may instead hark back to the earliest , limbless depictions of deities . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " In official writings , pharaohs are said to be divine , and they are constantly depicted in the company of the deities of the pantheon . Each pharaoh and his predecessors were considered the successors of the gods who had ruled Egypt in mythic prehistory . Living kings were equated with Horus and called the \" son \" of many deities , particularly Osiris and Ra ; deceased kings were equated with these elder gods . Pharaohs had their own mortuary temples where rituals were performed for them during their lives and after their deaths . But few pharaohs were worshipped as gods long after their lifetimes , and non @-@ official texts portray kings in a human light . For these reasons , scholars disagree about how genuinely most Egyptians believed the king to be a god . He may only have been considered divine when he was performing ceremonies . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " However much it was believed , the king 's divine status was the rationale for his role as Egypt 's representative to the gods , as he formed a link between the divine and human realms . The Egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in , as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings to nourish them . These things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw , with their priests and laborers . Yet , according to royal ideology , temple @-@ building was exclusively the pharaoh 's work , as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead . These acts were a part of the king 's fundamental role : maintaining maat . The king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue to perform their functions , which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans could continue to live . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " Although the Egyptians believed their gods to be present in the world around them , contact between the human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances . In literature , gods may appear to humans in a physical form , but in real life the Egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The ba of a god was said to periodically leave the divine realm to dwell in the images of that god . By inhabiting these images , the gods left their concealed state and took on a physical form . To the Egyptians , a place or object that was \u1e0fsr \u2014 \" sacred \" \u2014 was isolated and ritually pure , and thus fit for a god to inhabit . Temple statues and reliefs , as well as particular sacred animals , like the Apis bull , served as divine intermediaries in this way . Dreams and trances provided a very different venue for interaction . In these states , it was believed , people could come close to the gods and sometimes receive messages from them . Finally , according to Egyptian afterlife beliefs , human souls pass into the divine realm after death . The Egyptians therefore believed that in death they would exist on the same level as the gods and fully understand their mysterious nature . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Temples , where the state rituals were carried out , were filled with images of the gods . The most important temple image was the cult statue in the inner sanctuary . These statues were usually less than life @-@ size , and made of the same precious materials that were said to form the gods ' bodies . Many temples had several sanctuaries , each with a cult statue representing one of the gods in a group such as a family triad . The city 's primary god was envisioned as its lord , employing many of the residents as servants in the divine household that the temple represented . The gods residing in the temples of Egypt collectively represented the entire pantheon . But many deities \u2014 including some important gods as well as those that were minor or hostile \u2014 were never given temples of their own , although some were represented in the temples of other gods . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " To insulate the sacred power in the sanctuary from the impurities of the outside world , the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them . People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues . The only exception was during festival processions , when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine . People did have less direct means of interaction . The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer , from doorways to freestanding chapels near the back of the temple building . Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use , and some families had shrines inside their homes . Despite the gulf that separated humanity from the divine , the Egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to approach their gods . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " Egyptian gods were involved in human lives as well as in the overarching order of nature .

But in the New Kingdom , when other nations were under Egyptian control , foreigners were said to be under the sun god 's benign rule in the same way that Egyptians were . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Thoth , as the overseer of time , was said to allot fixed lifespans to both humans and gods . Other gods were also said to govern the length of human lives , including Meskhenet , who presided over birth , and Shai , the personification of fate . Thus the time and manner of death was the main meaning of the Egyptian concept of fate , although to some extent these deities governed other events in life as well . Several texts refer to gods influencing or inspiring human decisions , working through a person 's \" heart \" \u2014 the seat of emotion and intellect in Egyptian belief . Deities were also believed to give commands , instructing the king in the governance of his realm and regulating the management of their temples . Egyptian texts rarely mention direct commands given to private persons , and these commands never evolved into a set of divinely enforced moral codes . Morality in ancient Egypt was based on the concept of maat , which , when applied to human society , meant that everyone should live in an orderly way that did not interfere with the well @-@ being of other people . Because deities were the upholders of maat , morality was connected with them . For example , the gods judged humans ' moral righteousness after death , and by the New Kingdom , a verdict of innocence in this judgment was believed to be necessary for admittance into the afterlife . But in general , morality was based on practical ways to uphold maat in daily life , rather than on strict rules that the gods laid out . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Humans had free will to ignore divine guidance and the behavior required by maat , but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves . A deity carried out this punishment using its ba , the force that manifested the god 's power in the human world . Natural disasters and human ailments were seen as the work of angry divine bas . Conversely , the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans . Both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities : Shed , who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm , and Petbe , an apotropaic god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Egyptian texts take different views on whether the gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly . Misfortune was often seen as a product of isfet , the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat , and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events . Some deities who were closely connected with isfet , such as Set , could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods . But some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery , while others give theodicies in the gods ' defense . Beginning in the Middle Kingdom , several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth . Because of this human misbehavior , the creator is distant from his creation , allowing suffering to exist . New Kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the Middle Kingdom . They emphasize humans ' direct , personal relationships with deities and the gods ' power to intervene in human events . People in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives . As a result , upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods ' favor as a way to guarantee a good life . Even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid , and after the New Kingdom came to an end , government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating the gods ' will . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " Official religious practices , which maintained maat for the benefit of all Egypt , were related to , but distinct from , the religious practices of ordinary people , who sought the gods ' help for their personal problems . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Official religion involved a variety of rituals , based in temples . Some rites were performed every day , whereas others were festivals , taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity . The gods received their offerings in daily ceremonies , in which their statues were clothed , anointed , and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor . These offerings , in addition to maintaining maat for the gods , celebrated deities ' life @-@ giving generosity and encouraged them to remain benevolent rather than vengeful . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Festivals often involved a ceremonial procession in which a cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque @-@ shaped shrine . These processions served various purposes . In Roman times , when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the Nile inundation , processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood . Processions also traveled between temples , as when the image of Hathor from Dendera Temple visited her consort Horus at the Temple of Edfu . Rituals for a god were often based in that deity 's mythology . Such rituals were meant to be repetitions of the events of the mythic past , renewing the beneficial effects of the original events . In the Khoiak festival in honor of Osiris , his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout . The returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god 's own life . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Personal interaction with the gods took many forms . People who wanted information or advice consulted oracles , run by temples , that were supposed to convey gods ' answers to questions . Amulets and other images of protective deities were used to ward off the demons that might threaten human well @-@ being or to impart the god 's positive characteristics to the wearer . Private rituals invoked the gods ' power to accomplish personal goals , from healing sickness to cursing enemies . These practices used heka , the same force of magic that the gods used , which the creator was said to have given to humans so they could fend off misfortune . The performer of a private rite often took on the role of a god in a myth , or even threatened a deity , to involve the gods in accomplishing the goal . Such rituals coexisted with private offerings and prayers , and all three were accepted means of obtaining divine help . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Prayer and private offerings are generally called \" personal piety \" : acts that reflect a close relationship between an individual and a god . Evidence of personal piety is scant before the New Kingdom . Votive offerings and personal names , many of which are theophoric , suggest that commoners felt some connection between themselves and their gods . But firm evidence of devotion to deities became visible only in the New Kingdom , reaching a peak late in that era . Scholars disagree about the meaning of this change \u2014 whether direct interaction with the gods was a new development or an outgrowth of older traditions . Egyptians now expressed their devotion through a new variety of activities in and around temples . They recorded their prayers and their thanks for divine help on stelae . They gave offerings of figurines that represented the gods they were praying to , or that symbolized the result they desired ; thus a relief image of Hathor and a statuette of a woman could both represent a prayer for fertility . Occasionally , a person took a particular god as a patron , dedicating his or her property or labor to the god 's cult . These practices continued into the latest periods of Egyptian history . These later eras saw more religious innovations , including the practice of giving animal mummies as offerings to deities depicted in animal form , such as the cat mummies given to the feline goddess Bastet . Some of the major deities from myth and official religion were rarely invoked in popular worship , but many of the great state gods were important in popular tradition . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The worship of some Egyptian gods spread to neighboring lands , especially to Canaan and Nubia during the New Kingdom , when those regions were under pharaonic control . In Canaan , the exported deities , including Hathor , Amun , and Set , were often syncretized with native gods , who in turn spread to Egypt . The Egyptian deities may not have had permanent temples in Canaan , and their importance there waned after Egypt lost control of the region . In contrast , many temples to the major Egyptian gods and deified pharaohs were built in Nubia . After the end of Egyptian rule there , the imported gods , particularly Amun and Isis , were syncretized with local deities and remained part of the religion of Nubia 's independent Kingdom of Kush . These gods were incorporated into the Nubian ideology of kingship much as they were in Egypt , so that Amun was considered the divine father of the king and Isis and other goddesses were linked with the Nubian queen , the kandake . Some deities reached farther . Taweret became a goddess in Minoan Crete , and Amun 's oracle at Siwa Oasis was known to and consulted by people across the Mediterranean region . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Under the Greek Ptolemaic Dynasty and then Roman rule , Greeks and Romans introduced their own deities to Egypt . These newcomers equated the Egyptian gods with their own , as part of the Greco @-@ Roman tradition of interpretatio graeca . But the worship of the native gods was not swallowed up by that of foreign ones . Instead , Greek and Roman gods were adopted as manifestations of Egyptian ones . Egyptian cults sometimes incorporated Greek language , philosophy , iconography , and even temple architecture . Meanwhile , the cults of several Egyptian deities \u2014 particularly Isis , Osiris , Anubis , the form of Horus named Harpocrates , and the fused Greco @-@ Egyptian god Serapis \u2014 were adopted into Roman religion and spread across the Roman Empire . Roman emperors , like Ptolemaic kings before them , invoked Isis and Serapis to endorse their authority , inside and outside Egypt . In the empire 's complex mix of religious traditions , Thoth was transmuted into the legendary esoteric teacher Hermes Trismegistus , and Isis , who was venerated from Britain to Mesopotamia , became the focus of a Greek @-@ style mystery cult . Isis and Hermes Trismegistus were both prominent in the Western esoteric tradition that grew from the Roman religious world . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Temples and cults in Egypt itself declined as the Roman economy deteriorated in the third century AD , and beginning in the fourth century , Christians suppressed the veneration of Egyptian deities . The last formal cults , at Philae , died out in the fifth or sixth century . Most beliefs surrounding the gods themselves disappeared within a few hundred years , remaining in magical texts into the seventh and eighth centuries . But many of the practices involved in their worship , such as processions and oracles , were adapted to fit Christian ideology and persisted as part of the Coptic Church . Given the great changes and diverse influences in Egyptian culture since that time , scholars disagree about whether any modern Coptic practices are descended from those of pharaonic religion .

The sector operates business jets , rotorcraft , piston and jet @-@ engined fixed @-@ wing aircraft , gliders of all descriptions , and lighter than air craft . Public transport operations include business ( or corporate ) aviation and air taxi services , and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector . Other commercial GA activities are aerial work , such as surveying and air ambulances , and flight training , which plays an important role in the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport ( CAT ) industry . Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation . It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement , and encompasses a range of air sports , such as racing , aerobatics , and parachuting , at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Of the 21 @,@ 000 civil aircraft registered in the UK , 96 per cent are engaged in GA operations , and annually the GA fleet accounts for between 1 @.@ 25 and 1 @.@ 35 million hours flown . The single most common class of aircraft is the fixed @-@ wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA , but the main area of growth over the last 20 years has been in the use of more affordable aircraft , such as microlights , amateur built aeroplanes , and smaller helicopters . There are 28 @,@ 000 Private Pilot Licence holders , and 10 @,@ 000 certified glider pilots . Some of the 19 @,@ 000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities . Although GA operates from more than 1 @,@ 800 aerodromes and landing sites , ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips , over 80 per cent of GA activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes .

At the lighter end of the GA spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies , and gliding is in transition from a self @-@ regulatory model to more formal governance by EASA . Airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of CAT operations has reduced the area in which GA flights can be freely conducted . The growth in CAT is also making access to larger airports more difficult for the GA sector , and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re @-@ development for more profitable uses . The UK planning system has no remit to consider the national significance of GA public transport operations , and generally does not favour the development of smaller aerodromes catering to the GA market .

For the purposes of a strategic review of GA in the UK , the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) defined the scope of GA as \" a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule \" , and considered it necessary to depart from the ICAO definition and include aerial work and minor CAT operations . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " The first aerodrome in the UK was established by the Aero Club at Muswell Manor on the Isle of Sheppey , and in May 1909 it was the venue of the first flight conducted in the country by a British pilot , John Moore @-@ Brabazon . In 1910 the Aero Club was granted the Royal prefix , took responsibility for controlling all private flying in the UK , and started issuing the first British pilot licences . The introduction of the de Havilland DH.60 Moth in 1925 revolutionised light aviation , and the Royal Aero Club , recognising the \" vital necessity of promoting civil flying \" , formed the Light Aeroplane Club scheme . Between 1925 and 1939 around 60 flying clubs were started , and more than 5 @,@ 000 pilots were trained . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " During World War II civil aerodromes were taken over for military use , existing military airfields were expanded , and new ones were built . This resulted in a significant inventory of facilities becoming available after the war . Pre @-@ war civil aerodromes , for example Sywell , were returned to civilian use . Surplus military airfields were closed , and in some cases , for example Beccles , subsequently re @-@ opened as civil aerodromes . The Ministry of Civil Aviation was created to regulate all civil aviation in the UK , and this task remained the responsibility of government departments until the establishment of the independent CAA in 1972 . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " With an expanded infrastructure in place , GA became established after the war when manufacturers such as Cessna and Piper introduced light aircraft designed for the private market . The Cessna 172 , developed from the late 1940s Cessna 170 , was introduced in 1956 , and became the world 's best selling single @-@ engine aeroplane . Single piston @-@ engine aircraft are still the most common class of aircraft in the UK GA fleet . The development of the Rogallo wing in the 1950s fostered the development of hang @-@ gliding during the 1960s and 1970s . The 1960s also saw experiments with motorised hang gliders , but it was not until the 1970s that this blend of technologies started to mature , resulting in the birth of the microlight movement . Another milestone in the development of GA was the 1964 introduction of the Learjet 23 . Although it was not the first business jet , it popularised corporate aviation , and established the personal jet as a \" whole new class of aircraft \" . \n", "label": 1}

Air taxi operations offer charter services for third parties , and business or corporate aviation uses company @-@ owned aircraft to transport employees and clients . Aircraft used in these operations include business jets , helicopters , and twin piston @-@ engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people . An example of this type of operation is the transport by helicopter of spectators to the British Formula One grand prix at Silverstone . This involves so many flights that , according to Cranfield Aviation Services , on race day the heliport is temporarily the world 's busiest airport .

School @-@ owned aircraft account for a significant amount of GA activity , both in terms of hours flown and aircraft movements . The pilot training element is regarded by the GA community as a key benefit that is critical to the supply of pilots for the airline industry . It is claimed by the General Aviation Awareness Council that 60 \u2013 70 per cent of professional pilots have self @-@ financed their flight training at GA schools , and one UK airline operator has stated that the industry must rely on 70 \u2013 80 per cent of new pilots coming from the GA sector . The CAA estimates that between 1996 and 2006 the number of new professional pilots following the unsponsored training route rose from 48 per cent to 59 per cent . The counter argument to this claim is that pilots can be trained outside of the UK , and that the airline industry is not therefore dependent on a healthy GA sector in the UK for its supply of pilots . The CAA concludes that a severe reduction in GA would give \" some merit to the argument that pilot recruitment would be threatened \" , but that the data on flying hours \" does not support such a gloomy outlook . \" Of course , reliance on other countries for pilot training means that the UK foregoes the economic benefit of the training activity . \n", "label": 1}

The CAA was established as the primary regulatory body for all aviation in the UK in 1972 . In 1991 it started working within the Joint Aviation Authorities ( JAA ) framework to implement agreed common standards , known as the Joint Aviation Requirements ( JAR ) , throughout the European Union ( EU ) . In 2003 this was taken a step further when the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) was established as the central EU regulator , taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities . The CAA acts as an agency of EASA on these issues , retaining its original regulatory powers in areas not yet transferred to EASA .

{"input": " Controlled airspace is essential for the provision of a known air traffic environment necessary for the safe operation of CAT . A CAA review found that \" mixing [ commercial ] operations with other users is considered undesirable , even untenable \" by commercial operators .

There are particular problems for GA around large airports , where Class A controlled airspace extends to ground level . The concentration of commercial operations and high demand for GA in the South East of England have also resulted in extensive areas of Class A controlled airspace there , which serve to channel uncontrolled GA operations through high @-@ collision @-@ risk hot spots . \n", "label": 1}

Because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation , the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process , and this issue is the principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to GA land use are made .

In January 1849 , McKay introduced a bill for a gold dollar , which was referred to his committee . There was much discussion in the press about the proposed coin ; one newspaper published a proposal for an annular gold dollar , that is , with a hole in the middle to increase its small diameter .

Another Whig , Massachusetts 's Charles Hudson , related that Patterson had sent a real and a counterfeit gold dollar to his committee and the majority of members had been unable to tell the difference . McKay made no answer to these claims , but others did , including New York Congressman Henry Nicoll , who assured the House that the counterfeiting allegations were greatly exaggerated . The point was , he indicated , that the double eagle and gold dollar were wanted by the public , and , in the case of the gold dollar could help money circulate in small communities where banknotes were not accepted .

Public Ledger reported that although gold dollars would not be struck in annular form , gold half dollars would be , to help fill the need for change . With the new Pierce administration , Thomas M. Pettit took office as Mint Director on March 31 , 1853 . In April , Treasury Secretary James Guthrie wrote to Pettit that there were complaints that the gold dollar was too small , often lost or mistaken for a small silver coin , and enquiring about reports the Mint had experimented with annular dollars .

An adaptation of Longacre 's princess for the larger gold coin was placed on the dollar , and a similar agricultural wreath on the reverse . The idea of making the gold dollar larger in this way had been suggested in Congress as early as 1852 , and had been advocated by Pettit , but Guthrie 's desire for an annular coin stalled the matter .

The Type 2 gold dollar was struck only at Philadelphia in 1854 and 1855 , at the three Southern branch mints in the latter year , and at San Francisco in 1856 , after the design was designated for replacement . To correct the problems , Longacre enlarged the head of Liberty , making it a scaled @-@ down version of the three @-@ dollar piece , and moved the lettering on the obverse closer to the rim .

She is a successful New York lawyer who has spent most of the past 35 years trying to overcome the traumas of her childhood , a goal she pursues through an academic fascination with Trujillo and Dominican history . Urania is deeply troubled by the events of her past , and is compelled to confront her father Agust\u00edn about his role in those events . Urania visits her father , finding him weakened by age and a severe stroke , so much so that he is barely able to respond physically to her presence , let alone speak . Agust\u00edn listens helplessly as Urania recounts his past as \" Egghead Cabral \" , a high @-@ ranking member of Trujillo 's inner circle , and his drastic fall from grace . Urania details Agust\u00edn 's role in the events that led to her rape by the Dominican leader , and to her subsequent lifetime of celibacy and emotional trauma .

In The Feast of the Goat , Vargas Llosa imagines the innermost thoughts of the dictator , and retells The Goat 's last hours from his own perspective . Trujillo 's character struggles with aging and the physical problems of incontinence and impotence . Through fictional events and first person narrative , the reader is given insight into the man who , during his \" thirty @-@ one years of horrendous political crimes \" , modernized the country 's infrastructure and military , but whose regime 's attacks against its enemies overseas ( particularly the attempted assassination of R\u00f3mulo Betancourt , president of Venezuela ) led to the imposition of economic sanctions on the Dominican Republic by the Organization of American States in the 1950s .

His first plan to kill Trujillo was foiled by the unsuccessful attempted overthrow of the regime by Cuban paramilitary forces .

{"input": " = = = Political corruption = = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The structure of Dominican society was hierarchical , with strongly gendered roles . Rafael Trujillo , the ruler , was a cruel dictator who haunts the people of Santo Domingo even 35 years after his death . He is a true caudillo , ruling with brutality and corruption . He creates a personality cult in his capitalist society and encourages decadence within his regime . Prior to promotion to a position of responsibility , an officer is required to pass a \" test of loyalty \" . His people are to remain loyal to him all cost , and are periodically tested by public humiliation and censure even though acts of disloyalty were rare . Trujillo violates women and children as an expression of political and sexual power , and in some cases takes the wife or child of his lieutenants , many of whom still remain blindly loyal . Even the church and military institutions are employed to give women to the tyrant for pleasure . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Many of the assassins had belonged to the Trujillo regime or had at one point been its staunch supporters , only to find their support for him eroded by the state 's crimes against its people . Imbert , one of the assassins , sums up this realization in a comment prompted by the murder of the Mirabal sisters : \" They kill our fathers , our brothers , our friends . And now they 're killing our women . And here we sit , resigned , waiting our turn . \" In an interview , Vargas Llosa describes the corruption and brutality of Trujillo 's regime : \" He had more or less all the common traits of a Latin American dictator , but pushed to the extreme . In cruelty , I think he went far far away from the rest \u2014 and in corruption , too . \" \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " = = = Machismo = = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " According to literary scholar Peter Anthony Niessa , the two important components of machismo are aggressive behaviour and hyper @-@ sexuality . Aggressive behaviour is exhibited by displays of power and strength , while hyper @-@ sexuality is revealed through sexual activity with as many partners as possible . These two components shape the portrayal of Trujillo and his regime in The Feast of the Goat . As Lorenzo observes , Vargas Llosa \" reveals traditions of machismo , of abusive fathers , and of child @-@ rearing practices that repeat the shaming of children , so that each generation bequeaths a withering of the soul to the subsequent one . \" \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " In a display of both aspects of machismo , Trujillo demanded of his aides and cabinet that they provide him with sexual access to their wives and daughters . Mario Vargas Llosa wrote of Trujillo 's machismo and treatment of women , \" [ h ] e went to bed with his ministers ' wives , not only because he liked these ladies but because it was a way to test his ministers . He wanted to know if they were ready to accept this extreme humiliation . Mainly the ministers were prepared to play this grotesque role \u2014 and they remained loyal to Trujillo even after his death . \" Trujillo 's sexual conquests and public humiliations of his enemies also serve to affirm his political power and machismo . In Niessa 's words , \" The implication is that maximum virility equals political dominance . \" \n", "label": 1}

The most apparent confrontation of memory is on the part of Urania Cabral , who has returned to the Dominican Republic for the first time in 30 years , and is forced to confront her father and the traumas that led her to leave the country at 14 . She was the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of the dictator himself , a sacrifice her father made to try to gain favor with the dictator again , a fact to which she alludes throughout the book , but which is only revealed at the very end : the book concludes with her recounting the memory of that night to her aunt and cousins , who never knew the true reason she left the country . When her aunt is surprised that she remembers all these details , she responds that while she forgets many things , \" I remember everything about that night . \" For Urania , forgetting the atrocities committed by the regime is unacceptable . Her father , on the other hand , is not capable of joining her in this process of remembering , since he has suffered a stroke and is not capable of speaking ; however , Urania is angry that he chose to forget these things while he was still capable of acknowledging them . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Memory is also important in the sections of the novel that deal with the assassins . Each recalls the events that led him to take part in the assassination of Trujillo . These incidents included the 1956 Galindez kidnapping and murder , the 1960 murder of the Mirabal sisters , and the 1961 split with the Catholic Church . These historical events are used by Vargas Llosa to connect the assassins with specific moments that demonstrate the violence of Trujillo 's regime . Trujillo , too , is shown reflecting on the past , not least his own formation and training at the hands of the US Marines . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " But above all Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to facilitate the novel 's attempt at remembering the regime . The novel opens and closes with Urania 's story , effectively framing the narrative in the terms of remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present . In addition , because of her academic study of the history of the Trujillo regime , Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole .

The government 's actions in The Feast of the Goat demonstrate the discourse of prohibition : foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo 's country as they were seen as a threat to the government 's ideas . Mario Vargas Llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " = = Fact and fiction = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The novel is a combination of fact and fiction .

The general details of the assassination are true , and the assassins are all real people . While they lie in wait for the Dictator to arrive , they recount actual crimes of the regime , such as the murder of the Mirabal sisters . However , other details are invented by Vargas Llosa , such as Amadito 's murder of the brother of the woman he loved . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Those within the regime are also a mix of fictional characters and real people . President Balaguer is real , but the entire Cabral family is completely fictional . According to Wolff , Vargas Llosa \" uses history as a starting point in constructing a fictionalized account of Trujillo 's \" spiritual colonization \" of the Dominican Republic as experienced by one Dominican family . The fictional Cabral family allows Vargas Llosa to show two sides of the Trujillo regime : through Agustin , the reader sees ultimate dedication and sacrifice to the leader of the nation ; through Urania , the violence of the regime and the legacy of pain it left behind . Vargas Llosa also fictionalized the internal thoughts of the characters who were non @-@ fictional , especially those of the Goat himself .

{"input": " A common comment on the novel is the graphic nature of the many acts of torture and murder which are depicted in the novel . Vargas lets the reader see the realities of an oppressive regime with a degree of detail not often used by his compatriots in Latin American literature , as Michael Wood suggests in the London Review of Books : \" Vargas Llosa ... tells us far more about the details of day @-@ to @-@ day intrigue , and the sordid , sadistic minutiae of torture and murder . \" Walter Kirn of the New York Times suggests that the \" grisly scenes of dungeon interrogations and torture sessions \" cast other aspects of the novel in a pale light , draining them of their significance and impact . Similarly , Kirn implies that the \" narrative machinery \" mentioned by Wood as being somewhat unwieldy also produces a largely superfluous storyline . The plot line centered on Urania Cabral is described by Sturrock as being an emotional centre that focuses the novel , and Wood agrees that her confrontations with past demons hold the readers attention .

Three of the RAAF 's five \" ancient \" DH.9 biplanes went down in the search \u2014 though all crews escaped injury \u2014 including Eaton 's , which experienced what he labelled \" a good crash \" on 21 April near Tennant Creek after the engine 's pistons melted .

Having purposely put the biplane trainer into a spin and finding no response in the controls when he tried to recover , Eaton called on Douglas to bail out . When Douglas stood up to do so , the spin stopped , apparently due to his torso changing the airflow over the tail plane .

Piloting his own light plane , he was greeted by four Wirraways that proceeded to escort him into landing ; the Minister subsequently complimented Eaton on the \" keen @-@ ness and efficiency of all ranks \" , particularly considering the challenging environment . When Fairbairn died in the Canberra air disaster shortly afterwards , his pilot was Flight Lieutenant Robert Hitchcock , son of Bob Hitchcock of the Kookaburra and also a former member of Eaton 's No. 21 Squadron . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " As senior air commander in the region , Eaton sat on the Darwin Defence Co @-@ ordination Committee . He was occasionally at loggerheads with his naval counterpart , Captain E.P. Thomas , and also incurred the ire of trade unionists when he used RAAF staff to unload ships in Port Darwin during industrial action ; Eaton himself took part in the work , shovelling coal alongside his men . On 25 February 1941 , he made a flight north to reconnoitre Timor , Ambon , and Babo in Dutch New Guinea for potential use by the RAAF in any Pacific conflict . By April , the total strength based at RAAF Station Darwin had increased to almost 700 officers and airmen ; by the following month it had been augmented by satellite airfields at Bathurst Island , Groote Eylandt , Batchelor , and Katherine . Handing over command of Darwin to Group Captain Frederick Scherger in October , Eaton took charge of No. 2 Service Flying Training School near Wagga Wagga , New South Wales . His \" marked success \" , \" untiring energy \" , and \" tact in handling men \" while in the Northern Territory were recognised in the new year with his appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire . Eaton became CO of No. 1 Engineering School and its base , RAAF Station Ascot Vale , Victoria , in April 1942 . Twelve months later in Townsville , Queensland , he formed No. 72 Wing , which subsequently deployed to Merauke in Dutch New Guinea , comprising No. 84 Squadron ( flying CAC Boomerang fighters ) , No. 86 Squadron ( P @-@ 40 Kittyhawk fighters ) , and No. 12 Squadron ( A @-@ 31 Vengeance dive bombers ) . His relations with North @-@ Eastern Area Command in Townsville were strained ; \" mountains were made out of molehills \" in his opinion , and he was reassigned that July to lead No. 2 Bombing and Gunnery School in Port Pirie , South Australia . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " On 30 November 1943 , Eaton returned to the Northern Territory to establish No. 79 Wing at Batchelor , comprising No. 1 and No. 2 Squadrons ( flying Bristol Beaufort light reconnaissance bombers ) , No. 31 Squadron ( Bristol Beaufighter long @-@ range fighters ) , and No. 18 ( Netherlands East Indies ) Squadron ( B @-@ 25 Mitchell medium bombers ) . He developed a good relationship with his Dutch personnel , who called him \" Oom Charles \" ( Uncle Charles ) . Operating under the auspices of North @-@ Western Area Command ( NWA ) , Darwin , Eaton 's forces participated in the New Guinea and North @-@ Western Area Campaigns during 1944 , in which he regularly flew on missions himself . Through March \u2013 April , his Beaufighters attacked enemy shipping , while the Mitchells and Beauforts bombed Timor on a daily basis as a prelude to Operations Reckless and Persecution , the invasions of Hollandia and Aitape . On 19 April , he organised a large raid against Su , Dutch Timor , employing thirty @-@ five Mitchells , Beauforts and Beaufighters to destroy the town 's barracks and fuel dumps , the results earning him the personal congratulations of the Air Officer Commanding NWA , Air Vice Marshal \" King \" Cole , for his \" splendid effort \" . On the day of the Allied landings , 22 April , the Mitchells and Beaufighters made a daylight raid on Dili , Portuguese Timor . The ground assault met little opposition , credited in part to the air bombardment in the days leading up to it . In June \u2013 July , No. 79 Wing supported the Allied attack on Noemfoor . Eaton was recommended to be mentioned in despatches on 28 October 1944 for his \" Gallant and distinguished service \" in NWA ; this was promulgated in the London Gazette on 9 March 1945 . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Completing his tour with No. 79 Wing , Eaton was appointed Air Officer Commanding Southern Area , Melbourne , in January 1945 . The German submarine U @-@ 862 operated off southern Australia during the first months of 1945 , and the few combat units in Eaton 's command were heavily engaged in anti @-@ submarine patrols which sought to locate this and any other U @-@ boats in the area . The Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command , Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock , considered the sporadic attacks to be partly \" nuisance value \" , designed to draw Allied resources away from the front line of the South West Pacific war . In April , Eaton complained to Bostock that intelligence from British Pacific Fleet concerning its ships ' movements eastwards out of Western Area was hours out of date by the time it was received at Southern Area Command , leading to RAAF aircraft missing their rendezvous and wasting valuable flying hours searching empty ocean . There had been no U @-@ boat strikes since February , and by June the naval authorities indicated that there was no pressing need for air cover except for the most important vessels . \n", "label": 1}

The same month , he became Australian consul in Dili . He had seen an advertisement for the position and was the only applicant with experience of the area . While based there , he accompanied the provincial governor on visits to townships damaged in Allied raids during the war , taking care to be circumspect about the part played by his own forces from No. 79 Wing . In July 1947 , Dutch forces launched a \" police action \" against territory held by the fledgling Indonesian Republic , which had been declared shortly after the end of the war . Following a ceasefire , the United Nations set up a commission , chaired by Eaton as Consul @-@ General , to monitor progress . Eaton and his fellow commissioners believed that the ceasefire was serving the Dutch as a cover for further penetration of republican enclaves . His requests to the Australian government for military observers led to deployment of the first peacekeeping force to the region ; the Australians were soon followed by British and US observers , and enabled Eaton to display a more realistic impression of the situation to the outside world . The Dutch administration strongly opposed the presence of UN forces and accused Eaton of \" impropriety \" , but the Australian government refused to recall him . Following the transfer of sovereignty in December 1949 , he became Australia 's first secretary and charg\u00e9 d 'affaires to the Republic of the United States of Indonesia . In 1950 , he returned to Australia to serve with the Department of External Affairs in Canberra .

His name figures prominently in the Northern Territory , commemorated by Lake Eaton in Central Australia , Eaton Place in the Darwin suburb of Karama , Charles Eaton Drive on the approach to Darwin International Airport , and the Charles Moth Eaton Saloon Bar in the Tennant Creek Goldfields Hotel . He is also honoured with a display at the Northern Territory Parliament , and a National Trust memorial at Tennant Creek Airport .

As an early teenager he befriended Brian \" Beav \" Waddell , who would later play guitars as part of the Devin Townsend Band and bass on the Devin Townsend Project . He participated in several metal bands while he was in high school , and founded Grey Skies at the age of 19 . Around the same time he joined a popular local group called Caustic Thought , replacing Jed Simon on guitar and playing alongside bassist Byron Stroud , both of whom would later become members of Townsend 's flagship band , Strapping Young Lad . In 1993 , Townsend began writing material under the name Noisescapes , a project he later described as \" just as violent as Strapping Young Lad \" . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Townsend recorded a Noisescapes demo and sent copies to various record labels . Relativity Records responded to Townsend with a record deal and Townsend began work on what was to be the first Noisescapes album , Promise . Shortly afterward , the label introduced him to musician Steve Vai . Impressed with Townsend 's vocal work , Vai offered him the role of the lead vocalist on his new album Sex and Religion . After recording Sex and Religion , Townsend accompanied Vai on a world tour in support of the album . Townsend soon landed a second touring gig , this time with the opening band of Vai 's tour , the Wildhearts . He played live with the band throughout half of 1994 in Europe , and appeared as a guest musician on their single Urge . Ginger , the band 's frontman , remained close friends with Townsend , later co @-@ writing several songs on Infinity and the Christeen + 4 Demos EP . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " While on tour with the Wildhearts , Townsend formed a short @-@ lived thrash metal project with Metallica 's then @-@ bassist Jason Newsted . The band , known as IR8 , featured Newsted on vocals and bass , Townsend on guitar , and Tom Hunting of Exodus on drums . The group recorded a few songs together , although Townsend says that they never intended to go further than that . \" People heard about it and thought we wanted to put out a CD , which is absolutely not true , \" he explains . \" People took this project way too seriously . \" A demo tape was put together , but the material was not released until 2002 , when Newsted published the IR8 vs. Sexoturica compilation . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Though Townsend was proud of what he had accomplished so early in his career , he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry . \" I was becoming a product of somebody else 's imagination , and it was mixing with my own personality , \" he later reflected . \" This combination was appalling . \" He pushed to get his own projects off the ground . Despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians , however , Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music . Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai 's offer , seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend 's music . \" I have a hunch they only offered me a deal to get me to sing with Steve , \" he mused . While touring with the Wildhearts , Townsend received a phone call from an A & R representative for Roadrunner Records , expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him .

Townsend began to record material under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad .

To this day , the album is widely considered Strapping Young Lad 's best work , with Metal Maniacs calling it \" groundbreaking \" and Revolver naming it \" one of the greatest metal albums of all time \" .

Hetfield was \" fucking pissed \" that Newsted was playing outside the band , and Newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects .

The case came about due to the death of H. John Heinz III , one of the US Senators from Pennsylvania , in a plane crash on April 4 , 1991 . Under the Seventeenth Amendment , state legislatures may give the Governor the power to appoint officials to fill temporarily vacant Senate seats until a special election can be held , and Pennsylvanian law contained a statute executing this and requiring no primaries for the special election . Instead , both the Democrats and Republicans would each internally select their candidates . John S.

{"input": " On April 4 , 1991 H. John Heinz III , one of the US Senators from Pennsylvania , was killed when his chartered plane collided with a helicopter inspecting its landing gear . Under the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , the legislature of each state has the power to permit the governor to fill the vacant seat until a special election can be held . In Pennsylvania , this power had been delegated , and Governor Robert P. Casey signed a writ on May 13 , 1991 , declaring November 5 the date for a special election and temporarily appointing Harris Wofford to fill Heinz 's now @-@ vacant seat . Under Pennsylvanian law , there was no need for a primary in such a situation ; instead , both the Democrats and Republicans would each internally select their candidate , who would run in the special election . John S.

{"input": " Trinsey argued that , by failing to allow for primaries , the state legislation prevented him from getting to select a candidate of his choice , and that this violated the Fourteenth Amendment ; the terms of the statute ( and absence of a requirement for primaries ) also allegedly infringed the rights of the electorate under the Seventeenth Amendment , which required the selection of Senators by popular vote ; Trinsey 's complaint was that the legislation had effectively delegated the power to choose candidates to political parties rather than the electorate . Accordingly , Trinsey filed a motion for a declaratory judgment to state that the statute was unconstitutional , and also requested that Wofford be removed from his seat . Counsel for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , joined by the office of the Governor , argued that the constitution did not require the holding of primary elections to fill vacancies , and that the statute \" protected valid and compelling state interests in protecting the validity of the electoral process and limiting the term of a [ governor- ] appointed Senator \" . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " The case was first heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania , where , following oral arguments , the judge dismissed both Trinsey 's motion to remove Wofford and the Commonwealth 's motion to dismiss . On June 10 , 1991 , however , the District Court declared the statute unconstitutional , stating that it violated both the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments due to the failure to ensure \" popular participation \" through the use of primary elections . This decision was reached following an analysis of the legislative history of the Seventeenth Amendment and electoral processes ; based on this analysis , the court concluded that the Pennsylvanian use of a nomination process before a special election implied a right to vote , which was violated by the lack of a primary and necessitated a strict scrutinising of the legislation . After considering the evidence , the court concluded that \" the interests the Commonwealth put forth in support of the statute could not outweigh the infringement of the right to vote \" , leading to the conclusion that the statute governing special elections was unconstitutional . \n", "label": 1}

In a unanimous opinion , the Court of Appeals ( consisting of Sloviter , Greenberg and Seitz ) confirmed that there was no restriction of any fundamental right , and therefore that the strict scrutiny process did not need to be applied . In the absence of this process , they held that the Seventeenth Amendment did not require primary elections to fill vacancies , and more broadly gave state legislatures wide discretion as to how to hold elections ; as such , the statute did not violate the constitution . In December 1991 the Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari , presumably because the special election had already taken place in November and the issue was thus moot . \n", "label": 1}

In the absence of guidance , the Court of Appeals took a narrow view of the issues , something she criticises . Under Pennsylvanian law , primaries are mandatory in all other elections , and in her opinion the lack of a primary in this case should have been judged to be a violation of Trinsey 's fundamental rights . Combined with the purpose of the Seventeenth Amendment - to ensure direct election - this should have led to the application of the strict scrutiny test , and the decision that the statute governing special elections was unconstitutional . Kevin M. Gold instead suggests that the test used in Valenti v. Rockefeller , an analogous decision over the validity of New York state electoral law . In Valenti , the judiciary applied the \" substantial state interests \" test , which involves simply looking at whether the statute in question furthers the interests of the states , who under the Seventeenth Amendment are given some discretion as to the electoral process they use . \n", "label": 1}

Many German officials and military officers were initially not given any clear guidelines on the treatment of Polish cultural institutions , but this quickly changed . Immediately following the invasion of Poland in September 1939 , the Nazi German government implemented the first stages ( the \" small plan \" ) of Generalplan Ost . The basic policy was outlined by the Berlin Office of Racial Policy in a document titled Concerning the Treatment of the Inhabitants of the Former Polish Territories , from a Racial @-@ Political Standpoint . Slavic people living east of the pre @-@ war German border were to be Germanized , enslaved or eradicated , depending on whether they lived in the territories directly annexed into the German state or in the General Government . \n", "label": 1}

Goebbels declared that \" The Polish nation is not worthy to be called a cultured nation \" . He and Frank agreed that opportunities for the Poles to experience their culture should be severely restricted : no theaters , cinemas or cabarets ; no access to radio or press ; and no education . Frank suggested that the Poles should periodically be shown films highlighting the achievements of the Third Reich and should eventually be addressed only by megaphone . During the following weeks Polish schools beyond middle vocational levels were closed , as were theaters and many other cultural institutions . The only Polish @-@ language newspaper published in occupied Poland was also closed , and the arrests of Polish intellectuals began . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " In March 1940 , all cultural activities came under the control of the General Government 's Department of People 's Education and Propaganda ( Abteilung f\u00fcr Volksaufkl\u00e4rung und Propaganda ) , whose name was changed a year later to the \" Chief Propaganda Department \" ( Hauptabteilung Propaganda ) . Further directives issued in the spring and early summer reflected policies that had been outlined by Frank and Goebbels during the previous autumn . One of the Department 's earliest decrees prohibited the organization of all but the most \" primitive \" of cultural activities without the Department 's prior approval . Spectacles of \" low quality \" , including those of an erotic or pornographic nature , were however an exception \u2014 those were to be popularized to appease the population and to show the world the \" real \" Polish culture as well as to create the impression that Germany was not preventing Poles from expressing themselves . German propaganda specialists invited critics from neutral countries to specially organized \" Polish \" performances that were specifically designed to be boring or pornographic , and presented them as typical Polish cultural activities . Polish @-@ German cooperation in cultural matters , such as joint public performances , was strictly prohibited . Meanwhile , a compulsory registration scheme for writers and artists was introduced in August 1940 . Then , in October , the printing of new Polish @-@ language books was prohibited ; existing titles were censored , and often confiscated and withdrawn . \n", "label": 1}

Within ten to twenty years , the Polish territories under German occupation were to be entirely cleared of ethnic Poles and settled by German colonists . The policy was relaxed somewhat in the final years of occupation ( 1943 \u2013 44 ) , in view of German military defeats and the approaching Eastern Front . The Germans hoped that a more lenient cultural policy would lessen unrest and weaken the Polish Resistance . Poles were allowed back into those museums that now supported German propaganda and indoctrination , such as the newly created Chopin museum , which emphasized the composer 's invented German roots .

By late 1940 , no official Polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation , and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the Nazi economy . Primary schooling was to last for seven years , but the classes in the final two years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week . There was no money for heating of the schools in winter . Classes and schools were to be merged , Polish teachers dismissed , and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the German minority or to create barracks for German troops . No new Polish teachers were to be trained . The educational curriculum was censored ; subjects such as literature , history and geography were removed . Old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed . The new educational aims for Poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless , and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to Germans .

As with other barrows , Coldrum has been interpreted as a tomb to house the remains of the dead , perhaps as part of a belief system involving ancestor veneration , although archaeologists have suggested that it may also have had further religious , ritual , and cultural connotations and uses . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history . Beginning in the fifth millennium BCE , it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence , abandoning the hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period . Archaeologists have been unable to prove whether this adoption of farming was because of a new influx of migrants coming in from continental Europe or because the indigenous Mesolithic Britons came to adopt the agricultural practices of continental societies . Either way , it certainly emerged through contact with continental Europe , probably as a result of centuries of interaction between Mesolithic people living in south @-@ east Britain and Linear Pottery culture ( LBK ) communities in north @-@ eastern France . The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors , because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Between 4500 and 3800 BCE , all of the British Isles came to abandon its former Mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle , to be replaced by the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age . Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period , there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement , architectural styles , and the use of natural resources . Throughout most of Britain , there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period , leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral , relying on herding cattle , with people living a nomadic or semi @-@ nomadic way of life . Although witnessing some land clearance , Britain was largely forested in this period , and it is unclear what level of deforestation the area of Kent had experienced in the Early Neolithic ; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south @-@ east Britain in the Late Bronze Age . Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic , covered by a woodland of oak , ash , hazel / alder and Maloideae . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " = = = The tomb building tradition = = = \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Across Western Europe , the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape . These were tombs that held the physical remains of the dead , and though sometimes constructed out of timber , many were built using large stones , now known as \" megaliths \" . Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic , instead being interned in collective burials with other members of their community . The construction of these collective burial monumental tombs , both wooden and megalithic , began in continental Europe before being adopted in Britain in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The Early Neolithic people of Britain placed far greater emphasis on the ritualised burial of the dead than their Mesolithic forebears had done . Many archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic people adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead , believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants . Archaeologist Robin Holgate stressed that rather than simply being tombs , the Medway Megaliths were \" communal mouments fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them . \" Thus , it has furthermore been suggested that Early Neolithic people entered into the tombs \u2013 which doubled as temples or shrines \u2013 to perform rituals that would honour the dead and ask for their assistance . For this reason , historian Ronald Hutton termed these monuments \" tomb @-@ shrines \" to reflect their dual purpose . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " In Britain , these tombs were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the surrounding landscape , perhaps at the junction between different territories . Archaeologist Caroline Malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of a variety of markers in the landscape that conveyed information on \" territory , political allegiance , ownership , and ancestors . \" Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb @-@ shrines served as territorial markers between different tribal groups , although others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society . Instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways . Many archaeologists have suggested that the construction of such monuments reflects an attempt to stamp control and ownership over the land , thus representing a change in mindset brought about by Neolithicisation . Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherers . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Archaeologists have differentiated these Early Neolithic tombs into a variety of different architectural styles , each typically associated with a different region within the British Isles . Passage graves , characterised by their narrow passage made of large stones and one or multiple burial chambers covered in earth or stone , were predominantly located in northern Britain and southern and central Ireland . Alternately , across northern Ireland and central Britain long chambered mounds predominated , while in the east and south @-@ east of Britain , earthen long barrows represented the dominant architectural trend . These earthen long barrows were typically constructed of timber because building stone was scarce in southern Britain ; archaeologist Aubrey Burl argued that these timber tombs might have been \" even more eye @-@ catching \" than their stone counterparts , perhaps consisting of \" towering carved poles , flamboyantly painted \" , but that evidence of such sculptures has not survived . The Medway Megaliths represent just one of these regional groups within the wider West European tradition of tomb building in this period . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " Although now all in a ruinous state and not retaining their original appearance , at the time of construction the Medway Megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain . Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the North Downs , they constitute the most south @-@ easterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles , and the only megalithic group in eastern England . Archaeologists Brian Philp and Mike Dutto deemed the Medway Megaliths to be \" some of the most interesting and well known \" archaeological sites in Kent , while archaeologist Paul Ashbee described them as \" the most grandiose and impressive structures of their kind in southern England \" . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " They can be divided into two separate clusters : one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east , with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between 8 and 10 km . The western group includes Coldrum Long Barrow , Addington Long Barrow , and the Chestnuts Long Barrow . The eastern group consists of Kit 's Coty House , Little Kit 's Coty House , the Coffin Stone , and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs . It is not known if they were all built at the same time , or whether they were constructed in succession , while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan , and are all aligned on an east to west axis . Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound , and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance . The chambers were constructed from sarsen , a dense , hard , and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent , having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene . Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area , and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Such common architectural features among these tomb @-@ shrines indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles . For instance , they would have been taller than most other tomb @-@ shrines in Britain , with internal heights of up to 10 ft . Nevertheless , as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic tomb @-@ shrines ( such as the Cotswold @-@ Severn group ) , there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments , such as Coldrum 's rectilinear shape , the Chestnut long barrow 's facade , and the long , thin mounds at Addington and Kit 's Coty . This variation might have been caused by the tomb @-@ shrines being altered and adapted over the course of their use ; in this scenario , the monuments would represent composite structures . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " It seems apparent that the people who built these monuments were influenced by pre @-@ existing tomb @-@ shrines that they were already aware of . Whether those people had grown up locally , or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere is not known . Based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs , Stuart Piggott thought that they had originated in the area around the Low Countries , while Glyn Daniel instead believed that the same evidence showed an influence from Scandinavia . John H. Evans instead suggested an origin in Germany , and Ronald F. Jessup thought that their origins could be seen in the Cotswold @-@ Severn megalithic group . Ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb @-@ shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe , and emphasised that the Medway Megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe . He nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was \" impossible to indicate \" with the available evidence . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " The monument originally consisted of a sarsen stone chamber , covered by a low earthen mound , which was bounded by prostrate slabs . As such , the archaeologist Paul Ashbee asserted that the monument could be divided into three particular features : the chamber , the barrow , and the sarsen stone surround . It is located on the edge of a large lynchet scarp , although it is difficult to ascertain what views would have been possible from the monument at the time of construction , due to a lack of information on how densely forested the vicinity was . However , if the area was not highly wooded , then 360 \u00b0 views of the surrounding landscape would have been possible . The monument 's axis points toward both the North Downs and the Medway Valley , which is similar to the other Medway Megaliths . Archaeologist Sian Killick suggested that the Coldrum Long Barrow might have been built within view of a nearby settlement , and that this \" may have been a key factor in the experience of ceremonies and rituals taking place at the tombs and may also have defined a link between the tomb builders and the landscape . \" \n", "label": 1}

As such , the barrow is a \" truncated wedge @-@ shape \" . The megalithic builders responsible for the Coldrum Stones positioned it on the top of a small ridge adjacent to the North Downs , and constructed it facing eastward , towards the River Medway . \n", "label": 1}

In its current state , the northern side of the chamber is made up of two slabs , one being 8 feet long , 7 feet , 6 inches deep , and 1 foot , 9 inches thick , and the other 5 feet long , 6 feet deep , and 2 feet thick . Conversely , the chamber 's southern side consists of a single slab , measuring 11 feet , 4 inches in length , 7 feet , 3 inches in depth , and 1 foot , 9 inches in depth at its thicker , eastern end . The western end of the chamber is closed off with a slab measuring about 14 feet , 6 inches wide , with a thickness of 1 foot and a depth of around 8 feet . A collapsed , broken slab lies at the opening eastern end of the chamber . It is also possible that a largely rectangular slab at the bottom of the slope had once been part of the eastern end of the chamber . Excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens ; twentieth @-@ century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement , allowing the stones to continue standing upright . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " A concave line of abrasion and polishing can be found on both one of the central kerb @-@ stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb @-@ stone on the south @-@ east of the monument .

Most prominently , the eastern side has largely collapsed , with the stones that once helped to hold up the side of the barrow having fallen to the bottom of the slope .

Between 1842 and 1844 , the Reverend Beale Post authored Druidical Remains at Coldrum , in which he described the monument , although it remained unpublished at the time . Associating the site with the druids of Britain 's Iron Age , Post 's suggestion was that the name \" Coldrum \" derived from the linguistically Celtic \" Gael @-@ Dun \" , and that the chiefs of some of the Belgic Gauls were interned there . He further reported that in both 1804 and 1825 , skulls had been found at the site . In 1844 , an antiquarian named Thomas Wright published a note on the Coldrum Stones and other Medway Megaliths in The Archaeological Journal . Wright had been alerted to their existence by a local vicar , the Reverend Lambert B. Larking , and proceeded to visit them with him .

In August 1863 , the Archaeological Institute , who were then holding their week @-@ long meeting in Rochester , took a tour to visit the site , guided by the antiquary Charles Roach Smith .

In an 1878 note published in The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland , Lewis noted that while many tourists visited Kit 's Coty House , \" very few goes to or ever hears of a yet more curious collection of stones at Colderham or Coldrum Lodge \" . He believed that the monument consisted of both a \" chamber \" and an \" oval \" of stones , suggesting that they were \" two distinct erections \" . In 1880 , the archaeologist Flinders Petrie included the existence of the stones at \" Coldreham \" in his list of Kentish earthworks ; although noting that a previous commentator had described the stones as being in the shape of an oval , he instead described them as forming \" a rectilinear enclosure \" around the chamber . He then included a small , basic plan of the monument . \n", "label": 1}

He returned the next year , noting that at this point , the brushwood had been cut away to reveal the megaliths . In his 1893 book Collectanea Cantiana , Payne noted that although it had first been described in print in 1844 , \" since that time no one seems to have taken the trouble to properly record them or make a plan \" , an unusual claim given that a copy of Petrie 's published plan existed in his library . For this reason , after gaining permission from the landowner , he convinced Major A. O. Green , Instructor in Survey at Brompton , to conduct a survey of the monument in August 1892 . He also wrote to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt @-@ Rivers , encouraging him to schedule the Coldrum Stones as a legally protected site under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 . Payne described the Coldrum Stones as \" the finest monument of its class in the county , and one worthy of every care and attention . \" Comparing it to other monuments of its type in Britain , he asserted that it was undoubtedly \" of sepulchral origin , belonging to a period anterior to the Roman domination of Britain . \" Payne also noted a folk tradition that there were stone avenues connecting Coldrum to the Addington Long Barrow , although added that he was unable to discover any evidence for the existence of this feature . \n", "label": 1}

Ultimately , he ended his note by urging for the site to be protected under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900 . In that same issue , Lewis included an added note in which he rejected the idea that the monument had once been covered by an earthen tumulus because he could see \" no evidence that anything of that kind ever existed \" , and instead he interpreted the site as a stone circle , comparing it to the examples at Avebury , Arborlow , and Stanton Drew , suggesting that the central chamber was a shrine . \n", "label": 1}

Excavation continued sporadically until at least 1926 . Human remains were discovered , and placed into the possession of Sir Arthur Keith of the Royal College of Surgeons . This excavation revealed all the existing sarsens surrounding the monument , a number of which had previously been buried beneath earth .

Weary of constantly being asked for her primary genre , she felt that recording a Christmas album would finally pave a way for her to explore other different genres . She remarked , \" I always get asked what genre I 'm in : ' Is this country or pop or rock ? What are you ? ' And what 's cool about making the Christmas album was , ' Oh , there are no limitations ! We can do whatever we want ! ' \" . She further added , \" The thing about Christmas is that it almost doesn 't matter what mood you 're in or what kind of a year you 've had \u2014 it 's a fresh start .

{"input": " Discussions about making her sixth studio album being a Christmas record began on December 2012 , a month after releasing her first greatest hits album , Greatest Hits \u2013 Chapter One .

Despite having been raised in a Jewish faith and unfamiliar with Christmas songs , Kurstin still agreed to produce the project . As a result , the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer ( the first being David Kahne solely producing My December in 2007 ) . It also marked the fourth time Kurstin had solely produced an entire studio album apart from being a member of the musical groups The Bird and the Bee and Geggy Tah ( the first three being Lily Allen 's It 's Not Me , It 's You in 2009 , Sia 's We Are Born in 2010 , and The Shins ' Port of Morrow in 2012 ) . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " Recording sessions of the basic instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin 's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville . In recording tracks for the album , Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh , contemporary sound to classic @-@ sounding music . He recalled , \" It was a lot of fun for us because we got to go back to our roots . When Kelly started singing , it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything . \" Further adding , \" We really experimented . It was so much fun and liberating . And it pays off . \" Kurstin , who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music , recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson , Kevin Dukes , Roy McCurdy , and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound . He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " In providing instrumentation for the record , Kurstin used all of his instruments such as a Mellotron and a Chamberlin , taping them from a distance to stimulate the Wall of Sound , a recording technique originally developed by Phil Spector that was popular in the early 1960s . He enlisted Clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself . Clarkson , who grew up singing in a chorus , was pleased with the aspect ; saying , \" Blending is something I knew how to do from childhood . Sometimes I 'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound . But I 've never had to do anything like this before \u2014 doing all my backup vocals , essentially being my own choir . \" Together , they began to record in May 2013 and continued through the summer of that year , beginning by recording \" White Christmas \" with Clarkson in the vocal booth and with Kurstin on a piano . She commented , \" The production is all him . I would be just like ' Hey , can we make this more jazz ? Hey , can we make this more bluesy . And he just , like Harry Potter , made this happen .

She recalled , \" What 's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz , rock and roll , you can do pop , you can do blues , like you can do all that stuff and it works \u2014 cause it 's all classic and it 's Christmasy sounding . \" She also noted that the album 's multitude of styles positively contributes to her artistic goal , saying , \" My best friend from childhood heard it and said , ' This is what you sound like , before everything else . ' And I agree , It 's my core sound . Back in the day , when artists came out with things like \" Fall to Pieces \" and \" Bridge over Troubled Water \" , those songs transcended genres .

{"input": " In gathering inspirations for Wrapped in Red , Clarkson started by listening to Bing Crosby 's and Rosemary Clooney 's soundtracks from the 1954 feature film White Christmas as well as Mariah Carey 's Merry Christmas ( 1994 ) and Merry Christmas to You ( 1997 ) by Reba McEntire . While Kurstin , who used to play in a jazz band , took influences from A Charlie Brown Christmas by the Vince Guaraldi Trio and A Christmas Gift for You by Phil Spector as his inspirations , which resulted to the album 's Wall of Sound resonance .

Written by Clarkson and Eubanks , \" Every Christmas \" , was the first song to be written for the album . She revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting Blackstock , McEntire 's stepson , saying \" Every Christmas , I was just like , ' This is going to be different , right ? I 'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone for the rest of my life ? ' \" . The seventh track is a cover of Elvis Presley 's \" Blue Christmas \" .

Originally written a pop song , they converted it as a Christmas song to fit the album 's theme , describing it as a crossover between Eartha Kitt 's \" Santa Baby \" ( 1953 ) and Madonna 's \" Material Girl \" ( 1984 ) .

{"input": " The Christmas 1994 nor 'easter was an intense cyclone along the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada . It developed from an area of low pressure in the southeast Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Keys , and moved across the state of Florida . As it entered the warm waters of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean , it began to rapidly intensify , exhibiting traits of a tropical system , including the formation of an eye . It attained a pressure of 970 millibars on December 23 and 24 , and after moving northward , it came ashore near New York City on Christmas Eve . Because of the uncertain nature of the storm , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) did not classify it as a tropical cyclone . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Heavy rain from the developing storm contributed to significant flooding in South Carolina . Much of the rest of the East Coast was affected by high winds , coastal flooding , and beach erosion . New York State and New England bore the brunt of the storm ; damage was extensive on Long Island , and in Connecticut , 130 @,@ 000 households lost electric power during the storm . Widespread damage and power outages also occurred throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts , where the storm generated 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) waves along the coast . Because of the warm weather pattern that contributed to the storm 's development , precipitation was limited to rain . Two people were killed , and damage amounted to at least $ 21 million . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " The storm originated in an upper @-@ level low pressure system that moved southeastward from the central Great Plains into the Deep South of the United States . After reaching the southeast Gulf of Mexico , the disturbance underwent cyclogenesis , and the resultant system moved through Florida on December 22 in response to an approaching trough . National Hurricane Center forecaster Jack Beven noted that \" as it moved out into the Bahamas , it appeared to take on the characteristics of a tropical storm . \" The uncertain nature of the storm prevented the NHC from issuing advisories on it , and forecasters lacked sufficient data to fully assess the cyclone for potential tropical characteristics . The same trough that pushed the storm across Florida had moved to the north , allowing for high pressure to develop in the upper levels of the atmosphere . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Deemed a \" hybrid storm \" , the cyclone rapidly intensified in warm waters of up to 80 \u00b0 F ( 27 \u00b0 C ) from the Gulf Stream combined with a cold air mass over the United States . The system continued to rapidly intensify while moving within the Gulf Stream ; it developed central convection , an unusual trait for an extratropical cyclone , and at one point exhibited an eye . Despite these indications of tropical characteristics , \" There was no front associated with it and it had a warm core , but the radius of maximum winds was more than 150 nautical miles ( 170 mi ; 280 km ) , so under the standard NHC criteria it didn 't qualify as a tropical storm . \" On December 23 and 24 , the nor 'easter intensified to attain a barometric pressure of 970 mb ( 29 inHg ) . An upper @-@ level low pressure system that developed behind the storm began to intensify and grew to be larger in size than the original disturbance . In an interaction known as the Fujiwhara effect , the broad circulation of the secondary low swung the primary nor 'easter northwestward towards southern New York and New England . The original low passed along the south shore of Long Island , and made landfall near New York City on December 24 . Subsequently , it moved over southeastern New York State . On December 25 , the system began to rapidly weaken as it moved towards Nova Scotia , before the pair of low pressure systems moved out to sea in tandem in the early hours of December 26 . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " Koushik Banerjea , a sociologist in the London School of Economics , notes that Sholay exhibits a \" sympathetic construction of ' rogue ' masculinity \" exemplified by the likeable outlaws Jai and Veeru . Banerjea argues during the film , the moral boundary between legality and criminality gradually erodes . Film scholar Wimal Dissanayake agrees that the film brought \" a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order \" to Indian cinema . Film scholar M. Madhava Prasad states that Jai and Veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society . Prasad says that , through the elements of revenge included in the plot and the application of Jai and Veeru 's criminality for the greater good , the narrative reflects reactionary politics , and the audience is compelled to accept feudal order . Banerjea explains that though Jai and Veeru are mercenaries , they are humanised by their emotional needs . Such dualism makes them vulnerable , in contrast to the pure evil of Gabbar Singh . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Gabbar Singh , the film 's antagonist , was well received by the audience , despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty . Dissanayake explains that the audience was fascinated by the dialogues and mannerisms of the character , and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions , a first for Indian melodrama . He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited . He further notes that , unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience 's attention as an object of male fetish , in Sholay , the male body becomes the centrepiece . It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy . Dissanayake argues that Sholay can be viewed as a national allegory : it lacks a comforting logical narrative , it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged , and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions . Taken together , these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India . The narrative style of Sholay , with its violence , revenge , and vigilante action , is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release . This tension culminated in the Emergency ( rule by decree ) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975 . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Dissanayeke and Sahai note that , although the film borrowed heavily from the Hollywood Western genre , particularly in its visuals , it was successfully \" Indianised \" . As an example , William van der Heide has compared a massacre scene in Sholay with a similar scene in Once Upon a Time in the West . Although both films were similar in technical style , Sholay emphasised Indian family values and melodramatic tradition , while the Western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach . Maithili Rao , in Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema , notes that Sholay infuses the style of the Western genre into a \" feudalistic ethos \" . Ted Shen of the Chicago Reader notes Sholay 's \" hysterical visual style \" and intermittent \" populist message \" . Cultural critic and Islamist scholar Ziauddin Sardar lampoons the film in his book The Secret Politics of Our Desires : Innocence , Culpability and Indian Popular Cinema , both for its caricature and stereotyping of Muslim and women characters , and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers . Sardar notes that the two most prominent Muslim characters in the film are Soorma Bhopali ( a buffoonish criminal ) , and an impotent victim of the bandits ( the imam ) . Meanwhile , the sole function of one female character ( Radha ) is to suffer her fate in silence , while the other female lead ( Basanti ) is just a garrulous village belle . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Some scholars have indicated that Sholay contains homosocial themes . Ted Shen describes the male bonding shown in the film as bordering on camp style . Dina Holtzman , in her book Bollywood and Globalization : Indian Popular Cinema , Nation , and Diaspora , states that the death of Jai , and resultant break of bonding between the two male leads , is necessary for the sake of establishing a normative heterosexual relationship ( that of Veeru and Basanti ) . \n", "label": 1}

Due to lacklustre reviews and a lack of effective visual marketing tools , it saw poor financial returns in its first two weeks . From the third week , however , viewership picked up owing to positive word of mouth . During the initial slow period , the director and writer considered re @-@ shooting some scenes so that Amitabh Bachchan 's character would not die . When business picked up , they abandoned this idea . After being helped additionally by a soundtrack release containing dialogue snippets , Sholay soon became an \" overnight sensation \" . The film was then released in other distribution zones such as Delhi , Uttar Pradesh , Bengal , and Hyderabad on 11 October 1975 .

Trade journals and columnists initially called the film a flop . In a 1976 article in the journal Studies : An Irish Quarterly Review , author Michael Gallagher praised the technical achievement of the film , but otherwise criticised it stating , \" As a spectacle it breaks new ground , but on every other level it is intolerable : formless , incoherent , superficial in human image , and a somewhat nasty piece of violence \" . \n", "label": 1}

On the film 's 35th anniversary , the Hindustan Times wrote that it was a \" trailblazer in terms of camera work as well as music , \" and that \" practically every scene , dialogue or even a small character was a highlight . \" In 2006 , The Film Society of Lincoln Center described Sholay as \" an extraordinary and utterly seamless blend of adventure , comedy , music and dance \" , labelling it an \" indisputable classic \" . Chicago Review critic Ted Shen criticised the film in 2002 for its formulaic plot and \" slapdash \" cinematography , and noted that the film \" alternates between slapstick and melodrama \" .

These and other popular dialogues entered the people 's daily vernacular . Characters and dialogues from the film continue to be referred to and parodied in popular culture . Gabbar Singh , the sadistic villain , ushered in an era in Hindi films characterised by \" seemingly omnipotent oppressors as villains \" , who play the pivotal role in setting up the context of the story , such as Shakal ( played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda ) of Shaan ( 1980 ) , Mogambo ( Amrish Puri ) of Mr. India ( 1987 ) and Bhujang ( Amrish Puri ) of Tridev ( 1989 ) .

{"input": " Hadji Ali ( c . 1887 \u2013 92 \u2013 November 5 , 1937 ) was a vaudeville performance artist , thought to be of Egyptian descent , who was famous for acts of controlled regurgitation . His best @-@ known feats included water spouting , smoke swallowing , and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience . Ali 's most famous stunt , and the highlight of his act , was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene , and then acting by turns as a human flamethrower and fire extinguisher as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop . While these stunts were performed , a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no trickery was employed . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Although never gaining wide fame , Ali had a dedicated following on the vaudeville circuit in the United States . He performed for heads of state including Tsar Nicholas II of Russia . Judy Garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and David Blaine identified Ali as his favorite magician . Portions of his act were captured in the short film Strange as It Seems ( 1930 ) and in Politiquerias ( 1931 ) , the Spanish @-@ language version of Laurel and Hardy 's Chickens Come Home . Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias : 1977 's Gizmo ! , and 1999 's Vaudeville .

{"input": " Hadji Ali was born into a working @-@ class family in approximately 1887 or 1892 , depending on the source consulted , probably in Egypt . His fame was as a practitioner of a recognized vaudeville subgenre known as a \" regurgitation act \" , involving the swallowing of material or objects and their regurgitation in various ways . Ali became aware as a child that he possessed an unusual gastric ability . He explained in response to audience questions at a performance held at St. Mary 's Hospital in Niagara Falls , New York , in May 1926 , that while swimming in the Nile as a ten @-@ year @-@ old boy , he naturally discovered that he could swallow a large amount of water and blow it out like a whale spouting . He continued to develop and refine the ability as he grew older . A more dramatic version of these events was provided by Ali 's daughter , Almina Ali , in an interview in England after his death . She stated that his abilities were first learned through a single incident : while bathing in the Nile , he inadvertently swallowed a fish and an ample volume of water . Instead of dying , as those present thought he might , Ali simply regurgitated the liquid and the fish without ill effect . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Ali learned that his regurgitation talents had the potential to entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen : \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " I tried out my tricks first of all in the street , swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain from one side of the road to the other ... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day , and chased me down the street . I thought he wanted to beat me up , but no \u2014 all he did was to put a coin in my hand and ask me to repeat the trick . Finally , he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Taking his abilities on the road , Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances . Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state . According to Ali , in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg , Russia . He stated that the Tsar \" must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration , which is now one of my most treasured possessions . \" Following World War I , Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world , learning more tricks as he went . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Ali came to the United States with Almina in the mid @-@ 1920s . They performed together at fairs , carnivals and in vaudeville , sometimes advertised under the collective name , \" Hadji Ali & Co . \" Almina played the part of assistant in her father 's act , billed in his shows as \" The Princess \" . Ali alone had a variety of stage names , including : \" The Great Egyptian Miracle Man \" , \" The Amazing Regurgitator \" , \" The Egyptian Enigma \" , \" The Human Aquarium \" , \" The Human Volcano \" and \" The 9th Wonder of the Scientific World \" . Ali has been described as a \" large , barrel @-@ chested and bearded man ... [ that cut ] an imposing figure in his Arab costume . \" \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Although Ali spoke a number of languages and became a naturalized U.S. citizen , it was reported that Almina acted as his interpreter in the United States and other places , as he did not speak English and was illiterate . Once he had gained some notoriety , Ali took on as his manager Hubert Julian , a former colonel in the Abyssinian Air Force . Although he developed a significant following , even being named Judy Garland 's favorite vaudevillian , Ali \" remained more a sideshow curiosity than a true vaudeville headliner \" according to at least one source . Nevertheless , at the time of his death in 1937 , Julian commented that Ali had \" earned big money in America \u2014 $ 1 @,@ 000 a week sometimes .

{"input": " The mainstay of Ali 's act was \" water spouting \" . After swallowing large amounts of water , 60 to 100 glasses at a time , he spouted the water in a continuous stream for a sustained period of time , sometimes approaching one minute . Another common trick was to swallow 30 to 50 unshelled hazelnuts ( although one of his posters advertised 40 pecans ) , followed by another nut of a different variety , such as an almond . Ali then brought them up one by one with the odd @-@ nut @-@ out produced at a mark called out by the audience . In another trick , Ali swallowed three to six handkerchiefs of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " In a 1929 article appearing in the Lowell Sun newspaper , physician Morris Fishbein speculated that for Ali 's nut feat , the one nut of a different variety was held in the mouth rather than swallowed , thus allowing him to produce it on cue . Dr. Fishbein also stated that unnamed \" investigators \" were convinced that for Ali 's handkerchief stunt , to produce them in the sequence stipulated by the audience Ali flavored the cloth , and could therefore taste for the correct one as he brought them up . Ali also swallowed live goldfish , watches , coins , costume jewelry , paper money , peach pits , stones , live mice , buttons , pool balls and other odd objects . In another standard performance segment , he placed eight or more lit cigarettes in his mouth but instead of inhaling , he swallowed the smoke and , after a significant time had passed , issued it forth in a steady stream like an erupting volcano . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " Ali 's longstanding finale was the swallowing of copious amounts of water again , but this time followed by a pint of kerosene . A prop was then produced , typically a model castle or house made of metal set on a table , within which a small flame burned . Lighter than water and immiscible with it , the kerosene floated above the liquid in Ali 's gut , allowing him to disgorge it first . The stage thus set , and to a drum roll or an imitation of fire bells , Ali became a \" human flamethrower \" , spewing the accelerant in a long stream over the sacrificial prop , setting it ablaze . Once the kerosene was exhausted , the water followed , streaming out his mouth in a long flow from up to six feet away , extinguishing the fire . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " At some performances , a panel or \" jury \" from the audience was invited on stage to verify that no trick mechanism was being employed \u2014 that he was actually swallowing the items in question and delivering them back through acts of regurgitation . Sometimes Ali would stroll into the audience during his nut swallowing trick . His stomach exposed by his standard costume , he invited audience members to pat his stomach , allowing them to hear the nuts rattling within . One newspaper reported that Ali 's feats , essentially controlled vomiting , were performed in \" a manner without the least bit of unpleasantness or anything bordering on repulsiveness . \" Not everyone felt the same : at least one of Ali 's engagements was cut short once the proprietor realized that the nature of the act \" was killing their supper shows \" . Famed escapologist and magician Harry Houdini remarked in his 1920 work Miracle Mongers and Their Methods that water spouting was a \" performance that could not fail to disgust a modern audience . \" \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " The abilities of Ali fascinated the public and medical authorities . As reported in a 1928 Sheboygan Press article , at one of Ali 's acts a number of doctors attended and thoroughly examined him during the performance . They came away satisfied that he was actually imbibing and regurgitating the material and objects as claimed , but remained \" mystified over his extraordinary performance . \" According to an article appearing in the Naugatuck Daily News , \" Physicians of three continents have puzzled over the gastronomical mechanism of this human ostrich without success .

{"input": " In December 1789 , after five years of diplomatic wrangling about the terms of the Treaty of Mangalore that had ended the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War , the ruler of Mysore Tipu Sultan again declared war on the British East India Company and their allies in Southern India . For the next two years the war continued as British forces and their allies drove the Mysore armies back towards the capital of Seringapatam . Both sides were reliant on supply by sea to maintain their campaigns inland : the British forces were supported from their major ports at Bombay and Madras , later stationing additional forces at the small port of Tellicherry inside Mysore territory . The Mysorean forces were supplied through Mangalore by French ships . France had been an ally of the Tipu Sultan 's father Hyder Ali during the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War and although the political instability caused by the French Revolution in Europe prevented active involvement , they ensured that their ships kept up a supply of equipment to Mysore throughout the war . \n", "label": 1}
{"input": " In an effort to eliminate French support Commodore William Cornwallis , the British naval commander in the region , stationed a squadron of frigates at Tellicherry , where they were ideally situated to blockade Mangalore and prevent the passage of shipping into Mysorean territory . The squadron consisted of Cornwallis in HMS Minerva , Captain Sir Richard Strachan in HMS Phoenix and HMS Perseverance under Captain Isaac Smith . The French operated a squadron of their own on the coast , led by Commodore Saint @-@ F\u00e9lix and consisting of two frigates based at Mah\u00e9 , a small French port 7 miles ( 11 km ) south of Tellicherry .

Passing northwards , the convoy soon passed Tellicherry and Cornwallis sent Strachan with Phoenix and Perseverance to stop and inspect the French ships to ensure they were not carrying military supplies . As Smith halted the merchant ships and sent boats to inspect them , Strachan did the same to R\u00e9solue , hailing the French captain and placing an officer in a small boat to board the frigate .

In addition , R\u00e9solue was heavily outnumbered : no other French warships were in the area while the British had three large frigates within sight .

Cornwallis ordered the merchant ships released to continue their journey and for the frigate to be towed back to Mah\u00e9 , where it was anchored in the roads with its sails and topmasts struck . Provision was subsequently made at Mah\u00e9 by Strachan for the wounded French sailors .

In Britain , the Admiralty approved of Cornwallis ' actions , suggesting that the French were deliberately using the guise of trade to support Mysore against Britain . The action had no effect on the ongoing war in India , which was now centred on the inland city of Seringapatam .

Furtado has described the album as \" more urban , more American , more hip @-@ hop , [ and ] more simplified \" than her earlier work , which she said was more layered and textured because she \" tend [ s ] to overthink things \" . In contrast , during her studio time with Timbaland , she said she was \" in the VIP boys club of just letting go \" and being more impulsive . According to Furtado , instead of \" pristine stuff \" , the album features \" really raw \" elements such as distorted bass lines , laughter from studio outtakes and general \" room for error \" . Furtado has said Loose is not as much about the lyrics , which are not included in the liner notes , as it is about \" indulging in pleasures \u2014 whether it 's dancing or lovemaking . \" According to her , she wasn 't trying to be sexy with the album \u2014 \" I think I just am sexy now \" , she said . \n", "label": 1}

{"input": " The opening track , \" Afraid \" ( featuring rapper Attitude ) , is a description of Furtado 's fear of what people think of her , and she has said the chorus reminds her of \" walking down the hall in high school ... because you live from the outside in . Now that I 'm an adult , I care about the inside of me ... Before I said I didn 't care about what people thought about me , but I really did . \" \" Maneater \" is an uptempo electro rock song that combines 1980s electro synths and a more dance @-@ oriented beat . The up @-@ tempo song has prominent electropop and synthpop influences and is lyrically related to how people become \" hot on themselves \" when dancing in their underwear in front of a mirror . \" Promiscuous \" ( featuring Timbaland ) was inspired by a flirting exchange Furtado had with Attitude , who co @-@ wrote the song \n", "label": 1}

The album also features more introspective songs , and The Sunday Times wrote that it \" has a surprising sadness to it . \" The seventh track , \" Te Busqu\u00e9 \" , which features Latin singer Juanes , is about Furtado 's experiences with depression , which she said she has had periodically since she was around seventeen years old . Furtado said she was unsure what \" Say It Right \" is about , but that it encapsulates her feeling when she wrote it and \" taps into this other sphere \" ; in an interview for The Sunday Times , it was mentioned that it is about her breakup with DJ Jasper Gahunia , the father of her daughter . \" In God 's Hands \" , another song on the album , was also inspired by the end of their relationship . \n", "label": 1}

Maclean 's wrote that her makeover \" seems a bit forced \" and contrasted her with singers such as Madonna and Emily Haines of Metric : \" [ they ] seem to be completely in control , even somewhat intimidating in their sexuality : they 've made a calculated decision for commercial and feminist reasons .

{"input": " Johnson begins : \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " That praises are without reason lavished on the dead , and that the honours due only to excellence are paid to antiquity , is a complaint likely to be always continued by those , who , being able to add nothing to truth , hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox ; or those , who , being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients , are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses , and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy , will be at last bestowed by time . Antiquity , like every other quality that attracts the notice of mankind , has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it , not from reason , but from prejudice . Some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved , without considering that time has sometimes co @-@ operated with chance ; all perhaps are more willing to honour past than present excellence ; and the mind contemplates genius through the shades of age , as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity . The great contention of criticism is to find the faults of the moderns , and the beauties of the ancients . While an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance , and when he is dead we rate them by his best . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " To works , however , of which the excellence is not absolute and definite , but gradual and comparative ; to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and scientifick , but appealing wholly to observation and experience , no other test can be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem . What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared , and if they persist to value the possession , it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour . As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high , without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers ; so in the productions of genius , nothing can be stiled excellent till it has been compared with other works of the same kind . Demonstration immediately displays its power , and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years ; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man , as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours . Of the first building that was raised , it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square , but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time . The Pythagorean scale of numbers was at once discovered to be perfect ; but the poems of Homer we yet know not to transcend the common limits of human intelligence , but by remarking , that nation after nation , and century after century , has been able to do little more than transpose his incidents , new name his characters , and paraphrase his sentiments . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " The reverence due to writings that have long subsisted arises therefore not from any credulous confidence in the superior wisdom of past ages , or gloomy persuasion of the degeneracy of mankind , but is the consequence of acknowledged and indubitable positions , that what has been longest known has been most considered , and what is most considered is best understood . \n", "label": 0}

Whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions , local customs , or temporary opinions , have for many years been lost ; and every topic of merriment , or motive of sorrow , which the modes of artificial life afforded him , now only obscure the scenes which they once illuminated . The effects of favour and competition are at an end ; the tradition of his friendships and his enmities has perished ; his works support no opinion with arguments , nor supply any faction with invectives ; they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify malignity ; but are read without any other reason than the desire of pleasure , and are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained ; yet , thus unassisted by interest or passion , they have past through variation of taste and changes of manners , and , as they devolved from one generation to another , have received new honours at every transmission . \n", "label": 0}

His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid @-@ 1990s , and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning 's leadership during a 1996 interview .

John Nordling and Carl Molinder , the Swedish producers of the original film , were both involved as producers for the adaptation . Tomas Alfredson , the director of the Swedish film , was initially asked to direct the remake , but he turned it down stating that \" I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell . \" Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes initially referred to the film with \" If you call it a faithful remake , I think that 's true to say that 's what it is . It 's not a reimagining ; the same beats [ are there ] , maybe the scares are a little bit more scary . \" He later said , \" I call it his [ Reeves ' ] version .

He has stated on numerous occasions that he is not in favor of remaking his film . \" If one should remake a film , it 's because the original is bad . And I don 't think mine is , \" he said . Producer Donna Gigliotti said , \" We 're incredibly admiring of the original , but to be honest with you , that picture grossed $ 2 million .

In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one , Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren 't in the original film , stating that \" the story was so big that you couldn 't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book . \" Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film , stating \" There are things that [ Lindqvist ] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation . But there are some things that hopefully don 't detract and fit into the context of the story . It 's a mixture of details from the book , the original film and things that grew out of adapting it . \" In adapting the story for American audiences , Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil . He used Ronald Reagan 's \" evil empire speech \" as an example of American thought during that period . Reeves stated , \" The idea of Reagan 's ' evil empire ' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us . Evil was ' Other , ' it was over there , it was the Soviets \" . Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen , as he \" would be grappling with these very , very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [ Reagan era ] mindset and religiousness .

Los Alamos County granted a special request from the film 's director and producer to name the town in the movie \" Los Alamos , New Mexico . \" The local police department loaned the film crew 1980s style uniforms and patrol cars to use for the film and over 100 local teenagers were cast as extras . Reeves felt that Lindqvist 's story was very naturalistic and wanted the film to be shot the same way . After viewing Bright Star , he hired Greig Fraser as his cinematographer because he admired Fraser 's work with natural light on the film . Shortly before filming , Reeves sought advice from Steven Spielberg for directing child actors . Spielberg instructed Reeves to have the two leads each keep a diary in character with the intention of sharing with Reeves what they wrote in it . Reeves stated , \" It was all a process of trying to , not only guide them , but in places , trying to let them guide me toward their perspective . That was important . \" \n", "label": 0}

The studio 's supervisor Sean Faden , worked alongside the film 's visual effects supervisor , Brad Parker throughout the production . Several of the film 's scenes proved to be a challenge for the team . Director Reeves wanted the \" car @-@ crash \" sequence to appear as if it were filmed uncut in first @-@ person . Several plates were shot with the first involving actor Jenkins backing the car out of the gas station and swerving , the second plate shot had a model of the car capable of being spun mechanically on a \" rotisserie \" in front of a blue screen which could simulate the car 's roll down the hill . Jenkin 's stunt double and a dummy were placed in the car as the rotisserie spun with additional effects work used to animate the dummy as the car rolled . The two shots were then combined to deceive the viewer into believing that it was one complete shot . Houdini software was used for much of the film 's shots which involved Abby in her vampiric form . Faden noted the techniques used in another challenging shot important to Abby 's character in which she begins bleeding when she enters Owen 's apartment without invitation . Faden stated , \" Normally in such a scene , the character would be shot on set , dressed in blood . But in this case , the timing of the bleeding was so dependent on the emotional beats of the scene that this technique wouldn \u2019 t have allowed us enough control . \" Actress Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz was first shot with minimal prosthetic blood applied to her face for reference . Then using techniques utilized in a prior Method Studios film , A Nightmare on Elm Street , Faden had the Houdini software track Moretz 's shaking movements and render the gradual release of blood from her face . \n", "label": 0}

{"input": " Odex blamed the approximate 70 % fall in its Video CD ( VCD ) and Digital Video Disc ( DVD ) sales in 2006 and 2007 on illegal downloading . The response of anime fans was that the fall in sales was because Odex 's products were inferior , inaccurately translated , and released later than the online versions . Odex subsequently attributed the inaccurate subtitling on censorship laws against mature themes ( such as yaoi ) and on fansubbers \u2014 anime fans who had translated the Japanese dialogue \u2014 whom they had hired . In response , the Board of Film Censors said that it did not ask for subtitles to be changed , that it merely classified content , and that the onus was on distributors to ensure accurate subtitles . In addition to problems of quality and scheduling , criticisms were directed at Odex 's litigious strategy and poor public relations . Odex received support from the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore ( AVPAS ) in making its demands for compensation . \n", "label": 0}

Messages posted by Sing under the nickname \" xysing \" included \" Me too busy suing people \" [ sic ] and \" Hahahahah !

Sing asserted that threats of arson , assault and even death were made against him and filed a police report . Although he expressed regret over the remarks because they were a \" PR disaster \" and \" very wrong \" , he said that he had written them while feeling frustrated and did not apologise . He dismissed his \" double @-@ 6 @-@ ed \" remark , an expression of joy at the threats of lawsuits , as having been made \" two months ago \" , but it was revealed that they had been made only three weeks earlier . A Sunday Times article condemned these online responses as \" propaganda \" spread by \" lynch mobs \" and noted that some of these netizens had revealed the home addresses of Odex 's employees .

{"input": " Allegations were made by the online community that Odex had passed off fansubs as its own work . Sing admitted that this was partially true as Odex had hired anime fans to do subtitling in 2004 who had taken \" the easy way out and copied word for word the subtitles on fansubs they downloaded \" . Sing explained that when Odex released its anime , the company did not realise what the anime fans had done , and it has been \" paying for this mistake ever since \" . It was reported at the same time that all of Odex 's translation and subtitling was now done \" in house \" . However , Odex 's release of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya in September 2007 was found to contain translations strongly resembling an earlier unauthorised fansub release . Emails were also sent to the media saying that Sing and Go were directors and shareholders of a defunct company , Games Mart , that shared the same corporate address as Odex and had been raided in 1999 by the police for selling game consoles with unauthorized modifications . This information was confirmed by the press , and Go wrote a letter to the media explaining that Games Mart was not affiliated with Odex in any way . \n", "label": 0}

A protest by a few people with several action figurines took place on 25 August 2007 under intense police scrutiny , which was considered by Western observers to be a rarity in Singapore . An online group , Xedo Defense , was set up to provide support for the downloaders facing legal action .

He held that only copyright holders themselves , or their exclusive licensees , can bring such applications and that he was not satisfied with the evidence harvested by BayTSP for the identification of downloaders . Out of all the anime licensed to Odex , only the license in respect of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED had been granted exclusively to the company . The judge noted that , out of the 13 authorisation letters presented in court , ten of them authorised the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore ( AVPAS ) , not Odex , to act for the copyright holders .

{"input": " The case was covered extensively by the country 's newspapers . In The Straits Times of Singapore , lawyers who were interviewed said anime fans would not have a strong defence against Odex if proof of uploading or downloading of unauthorised videos was presented . In his analysis , Thomas Koshy \u2014 a legal academic writing in Today \u2014 questioned the legality of Odex 's threatening criminal prosecution of downloaders . Koshy maintained that only the Attorney @-@ General had the power to prosecute and that there was no indication that he had authorised Odex to conduct prosecutions on his behalf . Moreover , Koshy opined that it was improper for Odex to have combined its demand for compensation with a threat of criminal prosecution ; although Odex 's letters alleged \" illegal downloading activity \" , the company threatened punishment associated with the more serious offence of distributing materials which infringed copyrights . Koshy noted that Odex had cited a legal provision intended to regulate people 's file sharing for monetary gain rather than downloading by a casual consumer . Burton Ong , an associate professor at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law , suggested that an anime fan who downloaded a few episodes may have been able to rely on \" fair dealing \" as a defence against the charge of copyright infringement . One of the criteria for pursuing this line of defence would have been proving that the download subsequently boosted , rather than undermined , the commercial viability of the anime industry . \n", "label": 0}

{"input": " Bouldering is a form of rock climbing which takes place on boulders and other small rock formations , usually measuring less than 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) from ground to top , but in some cases can measure up to 30 + ft . Unlike top rope climbing and lead climbing , no ropes are used to protect or aid the climber . Bouldering routes or \" problems \" require the climber to reach the top of a boulder , usually from a specified start position . Some boulder problems , known as \" traverses , \" require the climber to climb horizontally from one position to another . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " The characteristics of boulder problems depend largely on the type of rock being climbed . Granite , for example , often features long cracks and slabs . Sandstone rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks . Other common bouldering rocks include limestone and volcanic rock . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " There are many prominent bouldering areas throughout the United States , including Hueco Tanks in Texas , Mount Evans in Colorado , and The Buttermilks in Bishop , California .

The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces , forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Climbing gyms often feature multiple problems within the same section of wall . In the US the most common method Routesetters use to designate the intended route for a particular problem is by placing colored tape next to each hold \u2014 for example , holds with red tape would indicate one bouldering problem , while green tape would be used to set off a different problem in the same area . Across much of the rest of the world problems and grades are usually designated by using a set color of plastic hold to indicate a particular problem . For example , green may be v0 @-@ v1 , blue may be v2 @-@ v3 and so on . Setting via color has certain advantages , the most notable of which are that it makes it more obvious where the holds for a problem are , and that there is no chance of tape being accidentally kicked off of footholds .

{"input": " = = History = = \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Rock climbing first emerged as a sport in the mid @-@ 1800s . Early records describe climbers engaging in what is now referred to as bouldering , not as a separate discipline , but as a form of training for larger ascents . In the early 20th century , the Fontainebleau area of France established itself as a prominent climbing area , where some of the first dedicated bleausards ( or \" boulderers \" ) emerged . The specialized rock climbing shoe was invented by one such athlete , Pierre Allain . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " In the 1960s , the sport was pushed forward by American mathematician John Gill , who contributed several important innovations . Gill 's previous athletic pursuit was gymnastics , a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for particular movements and body positions . He applied this idea to bouldering , which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds . Gill developed a closed @-@ ended rating system : B1 problems were as difficult as the most challenging roped routes of the time , B2 problems were more difficult , and B3 problems were those that had only been completed once . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Gill introduced chalk as a method of keeping the climber 's hands dry . He also emphasized the importance of strength training to complement technical skill . Neither of these practices had been popular among climbers , but as Gill 's ability level and influence grew , his ideas became the norm . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Two important training tools emerged in the 1980s : Bouldering mats and artificial climbing walls . The former , also referred to as \" crash pads \" , prevented injuries from falling , and enabled boulderers to climb in areas that would have been too dangerous to attempt otherwise . Indoor climbing walls helped spread the sport to areas without outdoor climbing , and allowed serious climbers to train year @-@ round regardless of weather conditions . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " As the sport grew in popularity , new bouldering areas were developed throughout Europe and the United States , and more athletes began participating in bouldering competitions . The visibility of the sport greatly increased in the early 2000s , as YouTube videos and climbing blogs helped boulderers around the world to quickly learn techniques , find hard problems , and announce newly completed projects . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " In early 2010 , two American climbers claimed first ascents on boulder problems that have come to be regarded as the most difficult in the world : The Game near Boulder , Colorado , established by Daniel Woods ; and Lucid Dreaming near Bishop , California , established by Paul Robinson . The following year , fellow American Carlo Traversi claimed the second ascent of The Game and in January 2014 , American Daniel Woods completed the second ascent of \" Lucid Dreaming . \" In 2011 , Czech climber Adam Ondra claimed the second ascent of Gioia , originally established three years earlier by Italian boulderer Christian Core , and suggested that it was among the world 's most challenging boulder problems . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " = = Equipment = = \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Unlike other climbing sports , bouldering can be performed safely and effectively with very little equipment , an aspect which makes the discipline highly appealing to many climbers . Bouldering pioneer John Sherman asserted that \" The only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders \" . Others suggest the use of climbing shoes and a chalkbag as the bare minimum , while more experienced boulderers typically bring multiple pairs of shoes , chalk , brushes , crash pads , and a skincare kit . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Of the aforementioned equipment , climbing shoes have the most direct impact on performance . Besides protecting the climber 's feet from rough surfaces , climbing shoes are designed to help the climber secure and maintain footholds . Climbing shoes typically fit much tighter than other athletic footwear , and often curl the toes downwards to enable precise footwork . They are manufactured in a variety of different styles in order to perform well in different situations : High @-@ top shoes , for example , provide better protection for the ankle , while low @-@ top shoes provide greater flexibility and freedom of movement . Stiffer shoes excel at securing small edges , whereas softer shoes provide greater sensitivity . The front of the shoe , called the \" toe box \" , can be asymmetric , which performs well on overhanging rocks , or symmetric , which is better suited for vertical problems and slabs . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Most boulderers use gymnastics chalk on their hands to absorb sweat . It is stored in a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist , allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb . Brushes are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs ; they are often attached to the end of a stick , pipe , or other straight object in order to reach higher holds . Crash pads , also referred to as bouldering mats , are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " = = Safety = = \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Boulder problems are generally shorter than 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) from ground to top . This makes the sport significantly safer than free solo climbing , which is also performed without ropes , but with no upper limit on the height of the climb . However , minor injuries are common in bouldering , particularly sprained ankles and wrists . Two factors contribute to the frequency of injuries in bouldering : first , boulder problems typically feature more difficult moves than other climbing disciplines , making falls more common . Second , without ropes to arrest the climber 's descent , every fall will cause the climber to hit the ground . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " To prevent injuries , boulderers position crash pads near the boulder to provide a softer landing , as well as one or more spotters to help redirect the climber towards the pads . Upon landing , boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics : spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid bone fractures , and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " = = Technique = = \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " As with other forms of climbing , bouldering technique is largely centered on proper footwork . Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles ; thus , proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning , relying on their legs to push them up the boulder . Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible , allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Bouldering movements are described as either \" static \" or \" dynamic \" . Static movements are those that are performed slowly , with the climber 's position controlled by maintaining contact on the boulder with the other three limbs . Dynamic movements use the climber 's momentum to reach holds that would be difficult or impossible to secure statically , with an increased risk of falling if the movement is not performed accurately . \n", "label": 0}

{"input": " The V @-@ scale , which originated in the United States , is an open @-@ ended rating system with higher numbers indicating a higher degree of difficulty . The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts . The scale begins at V0 , and as of 2013 , the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V16 . Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " The Fontainebleau scale follows a similar system , with each numerical grade divided into three ratings with the letters a , b , and c . For example , Fontainebleau 7A roughly corresponds with V6 , while Fontainebleau 7C + is equivalent to V10 . In both systems , grades are further differentiated by appending \" + \" to indicate a small increase in difficulty . Despite this level of specificity , ratings of individual problems are often controversial , as ability level is not the only factor that affects how difficult a problem will be for a particular climber . Height , arm length , flexibility , and other body characteristics can also be relevant . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " = = Environmental impact = = \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Bouldering can damage vegetation that grows on rocks , such as mosses and lichens . This can occur as a result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder , or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds . Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse , particularly by climbers laying down crash pads . Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails , or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer . Other environmental concerns include littering , improperly disposed feces , and graffiti .

{"input": " This lyric was a reference to the Ballymun flats , a group of seven local authority , high @-@ rise residential tower blocks built in the Ballymun neighborhood of Dublin during the 1960s . Paul Hewson ( later known as U2 's lead vocalist Bono ) had grown up on Cedarwood Road in the adjacent Glasnevin neighborhood , in a house across fields behind the towers , near his friends and future artists Fion\u00e1n Hanvey ( later known as Gavin Friday ) and Derek Rowan ( later known as Guggi ) . Bono had played in the towers ' foundations as they were being built , then traveled in their elevators for the novel experience . Over time , poor maintenance , lack of facilities for children , transient tenancies , and other factors caused social conditions and communal ties to break down in the flats . The place began to stink of urine and vomit , and glue sniffers and used needles were common sights , as were appearances of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na . Guggi later lived in the towers during years that he was struggling personally with drugs . It was through his exposure to people without hope in the flats that Bono began to develop his social consciousness . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Bono may have used Ballymun as the inspiration ( without any explicit lyrical references to it ) for the 1980 U2 song \" Shadows and Tall Trees \" , and later likened living in the area to some of the scenes portrayed in the 1992 Mike Newell film Into the West . Driving by there in 1987 , Bono said , \" See the seven tall buildings there ? They 're ' the seven towers . ' They have the highest suicide rate in Ireland .

{"input": " The song 's title phrase originated from Bono asking his brother how his struggling business was going , and the brother responding , \" It 's like running to stand still . \" Bono had not heard the phrase before , and he thought it expressed what heroin addiction and the effects of the drug on the body were like ; a writer later described the title as a \" perfect distillation of the dynamic of feeding on addiction . \" Bono had heard a real story about a pair of heroin addicts , a man and a woman , who lived in the Ballymun towers . Out of money and unable to pay the rent due to their habit , the man became a heroin smuggler , operating between Dublin and Amsterdam and taking enormous risks for a big payday . Bono felt the man was decent at heart but was constrained by his squalid living conditions , as well as poor choices , and Bono wanted to illustrate how these poor conditions affected their lives . The resulting lyric does not describe any of this explicitly , but instead limns the emotional atmosphere that the couple live in . In doing so , the song is not judgmental and shows sympathy for the woman . A character monologue from Wim Wenders ' 1984 film Paris , Texas , was also a significant influence on Bono 's writing of the song . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Although the lyrics of \" Running to Stand Still \" were worked on a great deal , the musical composition was essentially improvised by the band during the recording process at Dublin 's Windmill Lane Studios . Guitarist the Edge began playing some chords during a session for another song . Producer Daniel Lanois joined in on guitar , and the rest of the group followed . This initial improvised version incorporated all the elements of the final song structure , and the sound and feel of the group playing in a room together without overdubs contributed to the track 's effectiveness .

The influence of Reed 's works can be felt throughout the song , as can Van Morrison to an extent .

{"input": " Throughout its live history , \" Running to Stand Still \" has nearly always followed \" Bullet the Blue Sky \" , matching the order they appear on the album .

Bono mimed the actions of a heroin addict , rolling up his sleeves and then spiking his arm during the final lyric , after which he would sing \" Hallelujah \" over and over while reaching up into a pillar of white light . Writer Robyn Brothers sees the addition of the \" Hallelujah \" coda as indicating that while organized religion may act in the role of a sedative , a notion akin to other Zoo TV themes , the role of personal faith may still have a \" desiring , affirming , and ' deterritorializing ' force . \" At the culmination of the \" Bullet to Blue Sky \" to \" Running to Stand Still \" sequence , red and yellow smoke flares came out from either end of the stage ( an idea of U2 's security chief , who was a U.S. Vietnam veteran ) , as the coda segued into \" Where the Streets Have No Name \" .

( After July 2005 , it was replaced in that role and in the set list by \" Miss Sarajevo \" . ) During the 19 June 2005 show on Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi 's birthday , \" Running to Stand Still \" included snippets of \" Walk On \" , a song originally written for her . Author Steve Stockman felt that in this tour 's uses , \" Running to Stand Still \" was one of the band 's songs from the 1980s that had lost its original meaning and was no longer about drug @-@ dealing in the Ballymun towers . Rather , it was now being used to develop the show 's theme that a belief in faith and in human potential could overcome the bleakest and most desperate situations ; in this , it fit within the Vertigo Tour 's emphasis on coexistence and the ONE Campaign . This assessment agreed to by an eFestivals review , and author John Jobling has called the new interpretation an \" anti @-@ persecution paean \" that was used to remove the sting of \" Bullet the Blue Sky \" being used to criticize American behavior during the Iraq War . In contrast , USA Today 's veteran rock writer Edna Gundersen found the song 's performance still established a \" devastating \" mood and the New York Daily News said that the group \" thinned ' Running To Stand Still ' to give it a new mourning \" . Two other U.S. reviewers remarked that the song was lesser known to audiences , with Variety saying its inclusion helped the band connect with the past while avoiding clich\u00e9 . One tour performance of \" Running to Stand Still \" was included on the Vertigo 2005 : Live from Chicago DVD , during which Bono dedicated the Hallelujah coda to members of the American and British militaries fighting overseas .

The fan @-@ shaped castle was built from Portland stone , with a curved central tower and a gun battery , flanked by two angular wings . Shortly after its construction it was armed with eleven artillery pieces , intended for use against enemy shipping , operating in partnership with its sister castle of Sandsfoot on the other side of the anchorage . During the English Civil War , Portland was taken by the Royalist supporters of King Charles I , and then survived two sieges before finally surrendering to Parliament in 1646 . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Portland continued in use as a fort until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , when it was converted into a private house . Fresh concerns over invasion led to the War Office taking it over once again in 1869 , but the castle was not rearmed and was instead formed accommodation for more modern neighbouring fortifications . During the First and Second World Wars it was used as offices , accommodation and as an ordnance store . In 1949 , the War Office relinquished control , and in 1955 it was opened to the public by the state . In the 21st century it is managed by English Heritage and operated as a tourist attraction , receiving 22 @,@ 207 visitors in 2010 .

{"input": " Portland Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England , France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII . Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities , only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications , and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another , maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely . Basic defences , based around simple blockhouses and towers , existed in the south @-@ west and along the Sussex coast , with a few more impressive works in the north of England , but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " In 1533 , Henry broke with Pope Paul III in order to annul the long @-@ standing marriage to his wife , Catherine of Aragon and remarry . Catherine was the aunt of Charles V , the Holy Roman Emperor , and he took the annulment as a personal insult . This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 , and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England . An invasion of England appeared certain . In response , Henry issued an order , called a \" device \" , in 1539 , giving instructions for the \" defence of the realm in time of invasion \" and the construction of forts along the English coastline . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " As a consequence , Lord Russell inspected the coast along an anchorage known as Portland Roads , and concluded that two castles , Portland and Sandsfoot , should be constructed to protect it from naval attack . Work began that summer , with Oliver Lawrence acting as the royal paymaster for the project , and was completed by 1541 , at a cost of \u00a3 4 @,@ 964 . Thomas Mervin was appointed as captain , with a garrison of four gunners and two other men . In 1545 , Mervin was replaced by John Leweston , who also took on responsibilities as the Lieutenant of Portland , along with a larger garrison of 13 men , paid for out of the proceeds of the recent Dissolution of the Monasteries . A survey between 1547 and 1548 reported that the castle was equipped with one brass demi @-@ cannon , two brass demi @-@ culverins , four breech @-@ loading portpieces and four slings ; it also held eight hagbushes \u2013 a type of early arquebus \u2013 along with twenty @-@ three bows , twenty @-@ nine bills and twelve pikes . \n", "label": 0}

The castle finally surrendered to Vice @-@ Admiral William Batten in April 1646 .

In the late 1840s , the Portland Roads were converted into an artificial harbour through the construction of a breakwater , and new forts were built on the Verne heights and the sea front to protect it , although the structure of the old castle itself was left untouched by the growing complex of forts .

With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 , Portland Harbour became an important naval base and the castle was used an ordnance store . The castle became a military residence again in the interwar years , and during the Second World War it was used for accommodation and offices by British and US soldiers , with part of the castle used once again for storing ordnance .

She said that \" they don 't look like us , they don \u2019 t express themselves like us , they don \u2019 t lust like us . \" Anthropy compared the challenge of players who lead Jill through the game as similar to the challenges of a top who leads the bottom through a scene . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " = = = Art design = = = \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " While the character artwork for Mighty Jill Off was created by James Harvey , Anthropy first designed Jill in sprite form . Harvey was initially wary of doing work that was BDSM @-@ themed ; he felt that it was easy for something that is both cartoony and sexual to make viewers feel uncomfortable and used the Japanese harem anime genre as an example . He added that in humorous , sexually @-@ oriented cartoons , there is a \" fine line \" between \" cute and funny \" and \" repulsive \" . He wanted to design the relationship between the Queen and Jill in a way that people in the BDSM community could identify with it , while also avoiding putting people off who were not into BDSM . He used European comics as a model for his art work , which he admired for the \" permissive attitude they have to sex in cartoons \" . He also cited as inspiration specific Japanese cartoonists who he felt had successfully portrayed sex in animation such as Monkey Punch , the creator of Lupin III . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Harvey designed the Queen based on a loose description by Anthropy . He wanted to make her \" sexy and authoritative \" and to look like a \" fully grown human with relatively realistic proportions \" . He designed her to be an \" amalgamation of every lesbian friend \" he had been \" secretly been attracted to \" . He initially designed her with a veil , but felt that this was too superfluous and girly ; he decided to adorn her with spikes instead . He attempted to design the title screen 's background to \" emphasise the drama of [ the ] situation , or to expressionistically [ sic ] symbolise the characters in the scene \" . However , there were some hurdles ; he originally envisioned the Queen 's tower to be a smooth , straight one , but felt that it would be too phallic , which would be meaningless symbolism given the game 's content . Anthropy and Harvey held a contest for people to contribute fan art for the game ; the five winners won hand @-@ made Mighty Jill Off activity books , which included activities such as creating make @-@ out partners for a group of \" repulsive , tongue @-@ waggling oafs \" , as well as writing a poem for the game 's Queen .

The Queen 's more realistic design made him question whether a child @-@ like Jill would be appropriate . He designed several versions of Jill with different proportions and sent them to Anthropy so she could pick her favourite . He compared two of the designs to Nintendo characters Mario and Link ; the Mario @-@ like design he called a \" standard video game design \" , while the Link @-@ like design he called \" slightly realistic \" . The Link @-@ like design was the most realistic design that he did because he felt that making it too realistic could make it too difficult for players to identify with , and could diminish the humorous elements of the game .

{"input": " Anthropy told Harvey that she preferred characters with more realistic proportions ; as a result , he ended up with a design that was three and a half heads tall .

The evolution of her design resulted in Harvey having to redesign her appearance on the title screen . He employed different colors to demonstrate Jill 's feelings for the Queen ; he used a rose tint to demonstrate her \" blissful display of affection \" while using a grey wash to demonstrate her sadness . Harvey intended to add some red to her rubber body suit order to make her stand out from the background ; however , he felt that this made the suit look more like a \" crazy wrestler costume \" . He later thought to include grey in the design or to put her initials on her chest , but decided on using an all black design .

{"input": " Westley was born in Hounslow , London and he started his footballing career as an apprentice with Queens Park Rangers . During his time at QPR , Westley represented England at U18 level . He then joined Gillingham in March 1986 . He made two league appearances for the club before joining Barnet . He made three appearances and scored one goal for them in the Football Conference during the 1987 \u2013 88 season , making his debut for the club in a 2 \u2013 2 draw against Macclesfield Town at Moss Rose . Westley joined Wycombe Wanderers in the latter stages of 1987 for a fee of \u00a3 7 @,@ 500 , making a scoring debut in a 2 \u2013 1 away victory at Telford United . He scored in Wycombe 's next two games , and was a first @-@ team regular until manager Peter Suddaby left the club in January 1988 . Westley played just once under new manager Jim Kelman and left soon afterwards to sign for Kingstonian . He played 24 times for Wycombe , scoring five goals in all competitions during the club 's 1987 \u2013 88 campaign . He later played for a number of non @-@ League clubs , including Kingstonian , Wealdstone , Farnborough Town , Harlow Town , Enfield , Aylesbury United , Harrow Borough , Tooting & Mitcham United , Molesey and Walton & Hersham \u2013 three of which he would later go on to manage . During his time at Kingstonian , he suffered a dislocated ankle and broken leg in three places , which subsequently cut his playing career short after never fully recovering from the injury . On his playing career , Westley said \" I felt sorry for myself too often when I should have been leading the team \" . \n", "label": 0}

{"input": " While recovering from a broken leg , at the age of 28 , Westley was appointed as manager of Kingstonian in December 1996 after approaching the club about their vacant managerial post . His first two games in @-@ charge of the club both ended in 4 \u2013 4 draws against Walton & Hersham and Harrow Borough respectively , with Westley saying \" at the time , there was something raw and exciting about the team that I sent out . Although there was also something evidently missing \" . His first victory in @-@ charge of the club was a 2 \u2013 0 win over Wokingham Town in the Isthmian League Cup , before securing his first league win in the following game , a 5 \u2013 2 win away at Aylesbury United . Kingstonian drew clear of relegation , with Westley recalling a 3 \u2013 2 victory over champions Yeovil Town at Huish Park as a \" memorable victory \" . Despite securing safety for the club , he was sacked after just five months , being replaced by Geoff Chapple . He managed Kingstonian for 25 games recording nine wins , eight losses , and eight draws . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " In September 1997 , Westley was appointed as manager of another club he had previously played for in the form of Isthmian League Premier Division outfit Enfield . He appointed Graham Pearce as his assistant , who had also previously played for , and managed , Enfield . He outlined his ambition of ensuring the club returned to the top tier in non @-@ league , despite a host of financial difficulties at the club , he stated \" my ambition is to see silverware in the table , and if you can 't take the pressure , you shouldn 't take big jobs like this one \" . His first game as manager of Enfield was a 2 \u2013 0 home defeat to St Albans City . Despite securing a seventh @-@ placed finish for the club , Westley left the club after just nine months in charge .

He managed the club to a 12th @-@ place finish in his first season in charge , but enjoyed success in the Isthmian Cup ; winning the competition in 2000 . The following season , Westley guided the club to more success , winning the Isthmian League Premier Division ; securing 31 victories out of a possible 42 and amassing a total of 99 points . Westley overhauled the squad shortly after the club 's promotion to the Football Conference \u2013 something which he now states as a \" huge regret \" . At this point , he also tried to arrange a merger with Kingstonian \u2013 citing the club 's \" Football League rated ground \" as the reasoning behind his proposed idea , although it never happened due to \" fans resistance \" . During the 2001 \u2013 02 season , the club consolidated their position in the first tier of non \u2013 league football ; with Westley guiding the club to a 7th @-@ place finish in the league . The following season was to be a memorable campaign for Westley , reaching the Third Round of the FA Cup after a 3 \u2013 0 victory at Southport , where they faced Football League competition in the form of Darlington at Feethams . Westley guided the side to a 3 \u2013 2 win over Darlington , and the club were rewarded with a Fourth Round tie at home to Arsenal . The tie , however , was controversially moved to Highbury \u2013 because the tie stood to make around \u00a3 600 @,@ 000 in gate receipts from playing at Highbury , whereas playing at Cherrywood Road would only have generated the club an estimated \u00a3 50 @,@ 000 . Westley left the club after the sell @-@ out ' home ' tie at Highbury , which they lost 5 \u2013 1 . Shortly after his resignation , he became manager at Football Conference rivals Stevenage in January 2003 , signing a three @-@ year contract . Westley confirmed he would be leaving his shareholding in Farnborough to other existing shareholders , and would also be withdrawing his financial backing at the club . On moving to Stevenage , Westley said \" I 've enjoyed my time at Farnborough , but I feel that I need to move on now and that I need to concentrate on football management , which is where my ambitions lie \" . He went on to state that Stevenage 's \" long @-@ term potential \" was another key factor behind the move . \n", "label": 0}

{"input": " When Westley took over the Hertfordshire club , Stevenage were sitting 21st in the Football Conference , and were six points adrift of safety . Unlike his position at his previous club , Westley was appointed as first @-@ team manager , with no board involvement . He set about ensuring the club were still in the highest tier in non @-@ league football , signing seven players from his previous club Farnborough , as well as his former assistant Graham Pearce and goalkeeping coach Graham Benstead . His first game in charge of the club was a 1 \u2013 1 draw at home to Morecambe , before having to wait three games for his first win at the club \u2013 a 2 \u2013 0 victory away at local rivals Barnet , thanks to a Dino Maamria brace . The victory sparked an eight @-@ game unbeaten run , recording six victories on the bounce to ensure the club were safe from relegation . Westley had guided the club from 21st in the table to a respectable 12th @-@ place finish by the end of the season . The 2003 \u2013 04 season witnessed a much more consistent season under Westley 's management , but the club were unable to make the play @-@ offs and finished the campaign in 8th place , despite a positive start to the season . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " As was the case in previous seasons , Westley made wholesale changes at the end of the season , releasing several of the players he had originally signed from Farnborough , and replacing them with a mixture of players with Football League experience \u2013 in the form of Brian Quailey , Dannie Bulman , and Matt Hocking \u2013 as well as players from lower divisions such as Jon Nurse and Craig McAllister . Westley also gave first @-@ team opportunities to players who had progressed through the club 's youth system , most notably George Boyd . The squad originally struggled to perform , losing five games in the first eight games of the club 's league campaign . However , two victories by wide margins against lowly opposition in the form of Farnborough and Northwich Victoria respectively propelled the club into a mid @-@ table position . However , this was followed by two heavy defeats at the hands of York City and Canvey Island \u2013 the latter a 4 \u2013 1 home defeat against part @-@ time opposition . After the game , with hundreds of Stevenage fans calling for Westley to be sacked , he confronted fans in the East Terrace by saying he \" would turn it around \" . Westley 's side responded with four straight wins , and stayed within touching distance of the play @-@ offs for several months . An important double over Carlisle United in March 2005 , as well as crucial wins at Aldershot Town , Woking , and Crawley Town meant that Stevenage went into the final day of the season needing to beat already relegated Leigh RMI , and had to rely on Tamworth to hold Morecambe , who were currently occupying the final play @-@ off spot . Stevenage beat Leigh 2 \u2013 0 , while Tamworth held Morecambe to a goalless draw , ultimately meaning Westley 's side had reached the play @-@ offs on the final day of the season . Westley engineered two solid displays to ensure Stevenage overcame second @-@ placed Hereford United 2 \u2013 1 on aggregate , but lost 1 \u2013 0 to Carlisle United at the Britannia Stadium in the final . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " The 2005 \u2013 06 season marked Westley 's third season in charge as manager of the club , and although the club were consistent at Broadhall Way throughout the season , the side struggled for form away from home , winning just four games on the road all season . Stevenage 's poor away form was ultimately preventing the club from mounting any serious title challenge , and throughout the campaign Westley 's side would often \" lose the game before it began \" \u2013 in away games against Southport , Morecambe , and Burton Albion respectively , Westley 's side trailed 3 \u2013 0 before half @-@ time . Westley had also fallen out with striker Anthony Elding , who was eventually sold to Kettering Town in January 2006 . There were also increasingly frequent question marks surrounding the discipline of the squad under Westley 's control , as Stevenage received fourteen red cards during the campaign , more than any other club in the league by some distance . A 2 \u2013 0 defeat away to relegation @-@ threatened Forest Green Rovers on the final day of the season meant that Stevenage failed to reach the play @-@ offs , finishing 6th in the table . After failing to reach the play @-@ offs , Westley confirmed in May 2006 that he would leave the club when his contract expired in June , ending his three and a half year tenure with the Hertfordshire club . \n", "label": 0}

Westley secured the signatures of several players who he had previously managed at Stevenage ; signing the likes of Jamie Cook , David Perpetuini , and Dino Maamria . Westley also brought in the likes of Michael Bostwick and Chris Beardsley \u2013 younger players who he had previously written about in his weekly column in The Non @-@ League Paper when he was out of work . Westley 's newly assembled team secured five straight wins in the league , including wins away at the top two teams in the league at the time , Oxford United and Dagenham & Redbridge .

He said that \" the moment was right \" for him to come back into football and that he \" had some very good times at Stevenage before \" . His appointment was met with a fair bit of scepticism by Stevenage fans , but Westley promised to deliver a winning team , playing attractive football . Westley started by completely overhauling the squad in the summer transfer window and brought in no fewer than twelve players in an attempt to mount a serious Conference Premier title challenge . Among those brought in were Gary Mills and David Bridges , who Westley had managed during his short @-@ stint at Kettering .

However , through the first half of the club 's 2008 \u2013 09 campaign , Westley 's side were suffering from the same inconsistency that was common in his first spell as manager of the Hertfordshire side , losing three games on the trot in November \u2013 the last of which was a 2 \u2013 1 home defeat to Wrexham , it was to be Stevenage 's last defeat at Broadhall Way in the league for 18 months . Westley brought in former player , Dino Maamria as first @-@ team coach at the club . This , coupled with important signings during the campaign , such as Chris Day , Mark Roberts , and Jon Ashton , meant that Stevenage witnessed an up @-@ turn in form half way through the campaign . A 24 @-@ game unbeaten run stretching from December 2008 to April 2009 , as well as winning crucial games towards the latter stages of the season , ultimately meant that Westley 's men made the Conference Premier play @-@ offs , finishing in the last play @-@ off place . Despite taking a 3 \u2013 1 lead into the second leg , Stevenage lost 4 \u2013 3 overall on aggregate to Cambridge United .

{"input": " The majority of the squad that performed so well in the second half of the club 's 2008 \u2013 09 campaign were retained , with very little transfer activity in comparison to previous seasons under Westley .

Unlike in previous seasons , the club were performing strongly away from home , and secured victories at the likes of Luton Town and Mansfield Town . A 4 \u2013 1 victory against Cambridge United on New Year 's Day ultimately meant that Stevenage hit top @-@ spot for the first time in the season . However , two defeats on the road within the space of a week in February meant that rivals Oxford United had an eight \u2013 point lead going into March 2010 . The team responded well , winning eight games on the bounce ; including an important 1 \u2013 0 victory over Oxford United in late March , subsequently replacing Oxford at the top of the table . Borough brushed aside a late challenge from Luton Town , securing promotion to the Football League with two games to spare following a 2 \u2013 0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough . The team won their last six games of the league campaign without conceding a single goal , and recorded 42 points from a possible 45 from their last 15 league fixtures . Stevenage finished the season having amassed a total of 99 points from 44 games , winning the league by 11 points , with Westley winning many plaudits for the way he had secured promotion despite considerably less resources than a lot of the teams in the division . The promotion means Westley has led Stevenage to the Football League for the first time in their history , as well as managing a Football League team for the first time in his managerial career . Westley also guided the club to another FA Trophy Final ; this time losing 2 \u2013 1 after extra @-@ time against Barrow at Wembley Stadium . At the end of the season , Westley signed a new two @-@ year contract ; keeping him contracted to the club until 2012 .

Following four defeats in six games in December 2010 and January 2011 , Stevenage found themselves in 18th position , just four points above the relegation zone . However , during a congested period throughout February and March 2011 , Stevenage won nine games out of eleven , propelling the club up the league table and into the play @-@ off positions . This included winning six games on the trot , a sequence only matched by Bury . A 3 \u2013 3 draw against Bury on the final day of the season meant that Stevenage finished the season in sixth place .

On securing promotion , Westley said \" It 's a fantastic feeling . The players work so hard and they deserve everything they get \" . During the 2010 \u2013 11 season , Westley also guided the club to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup , where they lost to Reading 2 \u2013 1 . In the previous round , Stevenage beat Premier League side Newcastle United 3 \u2013 1 at Broadhall Way .

{"input": " The SR V class , more commonly known as the Schools class , is a class of steam locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell for the Southern Railway . The class was a cut down version of his Lord Nelson class but also incorporated components from Urie and Maunsell 's LSWR / SR King Arthur class . It was the last locomotive in Britain to be designed with a 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 wheel arrangement , and was the most powerful class of 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 ever produced in Europe . All 40 of the class were named after English public schools , and were designed to provide a powerful class of intermediate express passenger locomotive on semi @-@ fast services for lines which could cope with high axle loads but some of which had short turntables . Because of the use of a \u2018 \u2019 King Arthur \u2019 \u2019 firebox , rather than the square @-@ topped Belpaire firebox used on the Lord Nelsons , the class could be used on lines with a restricted loading gauge and some of the best performance by the class was on the heavily restricted Tonbridge to Hastings line . The locomotives performed well from the beginning but were subject to various minor modifications to improve their performance over the years . The class operated until 1961 when mass withdrawals took place and all had gone by December 1962 . Three examples are now preserved on heritage railways in Britain . \n", "label": 0}

{"input": " By 1928 the Southern Railway was well served by large 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 express passenger locomotives , but there was an urgent need for a class to fulfill intermediate roles throughout the system . Maunsell \u2019 s previous attempt at developing his predecessor \u2019 s L class for this task had proven a disappointment , and the Drummond D15 and L12 classes were approaching the end of their useful lives on these services . An entirely new secondary express passenger locomotive was required to operate over the main lines throughout the system including those that had relatively short turntables . \n", "label": 0}

{"input": " Maunsell \u2019 s original plan was to use large @-@ wheeled 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 4 tank engines for this purpose , but the Sevenoaks railway accident made him have second thoughts . He therefore chose a relatively short wheelbase 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 design although by this period 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 was more usual for this type of work . Authorities disagree as to whether Maunsell had in mind the restricted loading gauge of the Tonbridge to Hastings line when he designed the class , or whether this was an \" unexpected bonus \" when he was forced to substitute a \" King Arthur \" round @-@ topped firebox to his planned Belpaire design to reduce the axle load on the driving wheels to acceptable limits . In either event the class was undoubtedly Maunsell \u2019 s most immediately successful design , and the locomotives did some of their best work on the Hastings route . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " = = Construction history = = \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " The basic layout of the class was influenced by the existing \u2018 \u2019 Lord Nelson \u2019 \u2019 class 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 design , but the use of the round topped firebox enabled Maunsell to design the cab 's curved profile to fit the gauge restrictions of the Hastings line while allowing adequate forward visibility . The short frame length of the 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 locomotive also meant very little overhang on the line 's tight curves . To maintain the high power rating required for express passenger engines , Maunsell opted for a three @-@ cylinder design . In terms of tractive effort , the class was the most powerful 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 ever built in Britain , and were the only 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 type to be given the power classification of 5P by British Railways . They were well liked by crews . They also had a higher tractive effort than the nominally more powerful King Arthur class 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 0s , but at the cost of high axle @-@ loading : 21 long tons ( 21 t ) . The permanent way on the Hastings line therefore had to be upgraded during 1929 and 1930 to accept the new locomotive . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Permission was granted for the first batch of fifteen locomotives in March 1928 , but this was reduced to ten when it became apparent that they would not immediately be able to operate on the Hastings route . Production delays at Eastleigh railway works meant that they were not delivered until between March and July 1930 . Once the original batch had proved their worth and had been well received by the crews a further twenty locomotives were ordered in March 1931 for delivery between December 1932 and March 1934 . A third batch of twenty were ordered from Eastleigh in March 1932 for delivery after the completion of the previous order , but this was subsequently reduced to ten locomotives because of the continuing trade depression . The final locomotive in the class was delivered in July 1935 . \n", "label": 0}

After the electrification of the London to Eastbourne and the London to Portsmouth routes in the late 1930s the class also began to be used from Bournemouth . Under British Railways they were also widely used on cross @-@ country trains from Brighton to Cardiff and Exeter and on the Newhaven Boat Trains .

However , there was a drawback with such high power and relatively low weight ; when starting the locomotive from a standstill , wheelslips frequently occurred , calling for skilled handling on the footplate . \n", "label": 0}

{"input": " According to Casting Crowns ' lead vocalist Mark Hall , the concept for Come to the Well is the song \" The Well \" .

Hall noted that , in his life , \" when I come to Jesus , I 've already got my well figured out , I 've already got what I think is going to sustain me , I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work . We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells , but our wells are really holes in the ground \" . Hall argued that instead of using that approach , Chrsitians should \" start with Jesus , then we go to the world \" , and said that approach is what the album is about .

At a colloquium at Columbia in 1949 , Charles H. Townes reported experimental results that indicated quadrupole moments greater than those indicated by the shell model . It occurred to Rainwater that this could be explained and the differences between the liquid drop and nuclear shell models could be reconciled , if the atomic nucleus were not spherical , as had been assumed but could assume other shapes . Rainwater published his theoretical paper in 1950 . By chance , that year he was sharing an office with Aage Bohr , who took up the challenge of experimentally verifying Rainwater 's theory .

In 1856 , he received the first Mendelssohn Scholarship and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and then at Leipzig , where he also took up conducting . His graduation piece , completed in 1861 , was a suite of incidental music to Shakespeare 's The Tempest . Revised and expanded , it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862 and was an immediate sensation . He began building a reputation as England 's most promising young composer , composing a symphony , a concerto , and several overtures , among them the Overture di Ballo , in 1870 . \n", "label": 0}

Other early pieces that were praised were his Symphony in E , Concerto for Cello and Orchestra , and Overture in C ( In Memoriam ) ( all three of which premiered in 1866 ) .

Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works , it was hastily prepared , and its nature was more risqu\u00e9 , like Gilbert 's earlier burlesques , with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors . Two of the male characters were played by women , whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned .

Sullivan completed his Festival Te Deum ( 1872 ) ; another oratorio , The Light of the World ( 1873 ) ; his only song cycle , The Window ; or , The Song of the Wrens ( 1871 ) ; incidental music to The Merry Wives of Windsor ( 1874 ) ; and more songs , parlour ballads , and hymns , including \" Onward , Christian Soldiers \" ( 1872 ) . At the same time , the audience for theatre was growing because of the rapidly expanding British population ; improvement in education and the standard of living , especially of the middle class ; improving public transportation ; and installation of street lighting , which made travel home from the theatre safer .

The disgruntled former partners , who had invested in the production with no return , staged a public fracas , sending a group of thugs to seize the scenery during a performance .

{"input": " Gilbert and Sullivan sometimes had a strained working relationship , partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself as allowing his work to be subjugated to the other 's , and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two \u2014 Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin @-@ skinned ( though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness ) , while Sullivan eschewed conflict . In addition , Gilbert imbued his libretti with \" topsy @-@ turvy \" situations in which the social order was turned upside down . After a time , these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan 's desire for realism and emotional content . Also , Gilbert 's political satire often poked fun at the wealthy and powerful whom Sullivan sought out for friendship and patronage . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Gilbert and Sullivan disagreed several times over the choice of a subject . After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore , which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers , Sullivan asked to leave the partnership , saying that he found Gilbert 's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him . While the two artists worked out their differences , Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works . On each occasion , after a few months ' pause , Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan 's objections , and the partnership was able to continue successfully . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " In April 1890 , however , during the run of The Gondoliers , Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production . Among other items to which Gilbert objected , Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership . Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone . Gilbert confronted Carte , who refused to reconsider the accounts . Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that \" I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen \" . Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte \" in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial . \" As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained : \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " After all , the carpet was only one of a number of disputed items , and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things , but in whether Carte could be trusted with the financial affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan . Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts , and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others . It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance , but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time . Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891 , a year after the end of the \" Quarrel \" , that Carte had admitted \" an unintentional overcharge of nearly \u00a3 1 @,@ 000 in the electric lighting accounts alone . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Things soon degraded , a legal hearing was held , and Sullivan supported Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating that there were minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had with Lillian Russell . On 5 May 1890 , Gilbert had written to Sullivan : \" The time for putting an end to our collaboration has at last arrived . \" Gilbert later asked Sullivan to say he had been mistaken in his affidavit , but Sullivan refused . Gilbert felt it was a moral issue , and could not look past it . Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith , and in any event , Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte 's good graces : Carte was building a new theatre , the Royal English Opera House , to produce Sullivan 's only grand opera , Ivanhoe . Gilbert brought suit , and after The Gondoliers closed in 1891 , he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti , vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Gilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith , and Sullivan wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy . Gilbert eventually won the law suit , but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners . Nevertheless , the partnership had been so profitable that , after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House , Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer . In late 1891 , after many failed attempts at reconciliation , Gilbert and Sullivan 's music publisher , Tom Chappell , stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists , and within two weeks he had succeeded , eventually leading to two further collaborations between Gilbert and Sullivan . \n", "label": 0}

Neither work entered the canon of regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s . Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto , His Excellency ( 1894 ) , but Gilbert 's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh , his protege from Utopia , led to Sullivan 's refusal , and His Excellency was instead composed by F. Osmond Carr . Meanwhile , the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas , in between new pieces , and D 'Oyly Carte touring companies also played them in repertory . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " After The Grand Duke , the partners saw no reason to work together again . A last unpleasant misunderstanding occurred in 1898 . At the premiere of Sullivan \u2019 s opera The Beauty Stone on 28 May , Gilbert arrived at the Savoy Theatre with friends , assuming that Sullivan had reserved some seats for him . Instead , he was informed that Sullivan objected to his presence . The composer later denied that this was true . The last time they met was at the Savoy Theatre on 17 November 1898 at the celebration of the 21st anniversary of the first performance of The Sorcerer . They did not speak to each other . Sullivan , by this time in exceedingly poor health , died in 1900 , although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists , most successfully with Basil Hood in The Rose of Persia ( 1899 ) . Gilbert also wrote several works , some with other collaborators , in the 1890s . By the time of Sullivan 's death in 1900 , Gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been \" completely bridged over , \" and \" the most cordial relations existed between us . \" He stated that Sullivan was \" A composer of the rarest genius \u2013 who , because he was a composer of the rarest genius , was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be , but seldom is ....

{"input": " Sullivan has never had an equal for brightness and drollery , for humour without coarseness and without vulgarity , and for charm and grace . His orchestration is delightful : he wrote with full understanding of every orchestral voice . Above all , his music is perfectly appropriate to the words of which it is the setting .... He found the right , the only cadences to fit Gilbert 's happy and original rhythms , and to match Gilbert 's fun or to throw Gilbert 's frequent irony , pointed although not savage , into relief . Sullivan 's music is much more than the accompaniment of Gilbert 's libretti , just as Gilbert 's libretti are far more than words to Sullivan 's music . We have two masters who are playing a concerto . Neither is subordinate to the other ; each gives what is original , but the two , while neither predominates , are in perfect correspondence . This rare harmony of words and music is what makes these operas entirely unique . They are the work not of a musician and his librettist nor of a poet and one who sets his words to music , but of two geniuses . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " G. K. Chesterton similarly praised the combination of the two artists , anticipating the operas ' success into the \" remote future \" . He wrote that Gilbert 's satire was \" too intelligent to be intelligible \" by itself , and that perhaps only Sullivan could have given \" wings to his words ... in exactly the right degree frivolous and exactly the right degree fastidious . [ The words ' ] precise degree of levity and distance from reality ... seemed to be expressed ... in the very notes of the music ; almost ... in the note of the laughter that followed it . \" In 1957 , a review in The Times gave this rationale for \" the continued vitality of the Savoy operas \" : \n", "label": 0}

For this , each partner has his share of credit . The neat articulation of incredibilities in Gilbert 's plots is perfectly matched by his language .... His dialogue , with its primly mocking formality , satisfies both the ear and the intelligence . His verses show an unequalled and very delicate gift for creating a comic effect by the contrast between poetic form and prosaic thought and wording .... How deliciously [ his lines ] prick the bubble of sentiment .... [ Of ] equal importance ... Gilbert 's lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan 's music ....

[ He is ] a delicate wit , whose airs have a precision , a neatness , a grace , and a flowing melody .... The two men together remain endlessly and incomparably delightful ....

{"input": " Because of the unusual success of the operas , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company were able , from the start , to license the works to other professional companies , such as the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company , and to amateur troupes . For almost a century , until the British copyrights expired at the end of 1961 , and even afterwards , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide , creating a \" performing tradition \" for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors , both amateur and professional . Indeed , Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte had an important influence on amateur theatre . Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that , prior to the creation of the Savoy operas , amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals . After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies in the 1880s licensed to perform the operas , professionals recognised that the amateur performing groups \" support the culture of music and the drama . They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage , and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present @-@ day favourites . \" Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to \" the popularity of , and infectious craze for performing , the Gilbert and Sullivan operas \" . The National Operatic and Dramatic Association ( NODA ) was founded in 1899 . It reported , in 1914 , that nearly 200 British troupes were performing Gilbert and Sullivan that year , constituting most of the amateur companies in the country ( this figure included only the societies that were members of NODA ) . The association further reported that almost 1 @,@ 000 performances of the Savoy operas had been given in Britain that year , many of them to benefit charities . Cellier and Bridgeman noted that strong amateur groups were performing the operas in places as far away as New Zealand . In the U.S. , and elsewhere where British copyrights on the operas were not enforced , both professional and amateur companies performed the works throughout the 20th century \u2013 the Internet Broadway Database counts about 150 productions on Broadway alone from 1900 to 1960 . The Savoy Company , an amateur group formed in 1901 in Philadelphia , continues to perform today . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Recordings of excerpts from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas began to be released in 1906 . In 1917 , the Gramophone Company ( also known as HMV ) produced the first album of a complete musical score of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera , The Mikado , followed by recordings of eight more of the operas . Electrical recordings of the complete musical scores of most of the operas were then issued by the Gramophone Company and Victor Talking Machine Company beginning in the late 1920s . These recordings were supervised by Rupert D 'Oyly Carte . The original D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce well @-@ regarded recordings until 1979 , helping to keep the operas popular through the decades . Many of these recordings have been reissued on CD . After the copyrights on the operas expired , other professional companies were free to perform and record the operas . Many performing companies arose to produce the works , such as Gilbert and Sullivan for All in Britain and the Light Opera of Manhattan and Light Opera Works in the U.S. , and existing companies , such as English National Opera and Australian Opera added Gilbert and Sullivan to their repertories . These companies also released popular audio and video recordings of the operas . In 1980 , a Broadway and West End production of Pirates produced by Joseph Papp brought new audiences to Gilbert and Sullivan , and between 1988 and 2003 , the revived D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company revived the operas on tour and on the West End , also recording seven of the operas . A set of eleven of the operas ( omitting the last two ) was produced in 1982 for television , ten of which are available on VHS and DVD . \n", "label": 0}

Since 1994 , a three @-@ week @-@ long International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has been held every August in England , with some two dozen or more performances of the operas given on the main stage , and several dozen related \" fringe \" events given in smaller venues . The Festival sells both professional and amateur videos of its most popular productions . In connection with the 2009 festival , a contemporary critic wrote , \" The appeal of G & S \u2019 s special blend of charm , silliness and gentle satire seems immune to fashion . \" There continue to be hundreds of amateur companies performing the Gilbert and Sullivan works worldwide . \n", "label": 0}

Well , hardly ever ! \" , \" let the punishment fit the crime \" , and \" A policeman 's lot is not a happy one \" .

Gilbert 's lyrics served as a model for such 20th @-@ century Broadway lyricists as Cole Porter , Ira Gershwin , and Lorenz Hart . No\u00ebl Coward wrote : \" I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously .

{"input": " The musical is not , of course , the only cultural form to show the influence of G & S. Even more direct heirs are those witty and satirical songwriters found on both sides of the Atlantic in the twentieth century like Michael Flanders and Donald Swann in the United Kingdom and Tom Lehrer in the United States . The influence of Gilbert is discernible in a vein of British comedy that runs through John Betjeman 's verse via Monty Python and Private Eye to ... television series like Yes , Minister ... where the emphasis is on wit , irony , and poking fun at the establishment from within it in a way which manages to be both disrespectful of authority and yet cosily comfortable and urbane . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " The works of Gilbert and Sullivan are themselves frequently pastiched and parodied . Well known examples of this include Tom Lehrer 's The Elements and Clementine ; Allan Sherman 's I 'm Called Little Butterball , When I Was a Lad , You Need an Analyst and The Bronx Bird @-@ Watcher ; and The Two Ronnies ' 1973 Christmas Special . Other comedians have used Gilbert and Sullivan songs as a key part of their routines , including Hinge and Bracket , Anna Russell , and the HMS Yakko episode of the animated TV series Animaniacs . Songs from Gilbert and Sullivan are often pastiched in advertising , and elaborate advertising parodies have been published , as have the likenesses of various Gilbert and Sullivan performers throughout the decades . Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas are commonly referenced in literature , film and television in various ways that include extensive use of Sullivan 's music or where action occurs during a performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera , such as in the film The Girl Said No . There are also a number of Gilbert and Sullivan biographical films , such as Mike Leigh 's Topsy @-@ Turvy ( 2000 ) and The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan ( 1953 ) , as well as shows about the partnership , including a 1938 Broadway show , Knights of Song and a 1975 West End show called Tarantara !

{"input": " It is not surprising , given the focus of Gilbert on politics , that politicians and political observers have often found inspiration in these works . Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist added gold stripes to his judicial robes after seeing them used by the Lord Chancellor in a production of Iolanthe . Alternatively , Lord Chancellor Charles Falconer is recorded as objecting so strongly to Iolanthe 's comic portrayal of Lord Chancellors that he supported moves to disband the office . British politicians , beyond quoting some of the more famous lines , have delivered speeches in the form of Gilbert and Sullivan pastiches . These include Conservative Peter Lilley 's speech mimicking the form of \" I 've got a little list \" from The Mikado , listing those he was against , including \" sponging socialists \" and \" young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue \" .

Thespis is now lost , but there is no doubt that Sullivan wrote its overture . Very early performances of The Sorcerer used a section of Sullivan 's incidental music to Shakespeare 's Henry the VIII , as he did not have time to write a new overture , but this was replaced in 1884 by one executed by Hamilton Clarke . Of those remaining , the overtures to H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance are by Alfred Cellier , the overture to Patience is by Eugene d 'Albert , and those to The Mikado and Ruddigore are by Hamilton Clarke ( although the Ruddigore overture was later replaced by one written by Geoffrey Toye ) . \n", "label": 0}

Toye 's Pirates overture , however , did not last long and is now presumed lost .

As the NSWRL premiership had already begun , the NSWRL had to reformat the draw to include Cumberland , which meant increasing the number of teams from eight to nine .

After enduring the harsh winter of 1916 \u2013 17 , early in the new year the Germans withdrew between 15 \u2013 50 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 \u2013 31 @.@ 1 mi ) across a broad front between Arras and the Aisne , as part of a plan to shorten their lines and free up reserves . A brief advance followed , as the Australians followed their opponents up , before they were checked by the strongly prepared defences of the Hindenburg Line . In early April , as a preliminary to the First Battle of Bullecourt , the 13th Brigade was thrown into an attack around Noreuil , during which the 49th was initially placed in brigade reserve , before putting in an attack that captured a railway cutting on the Cambrai \u2013 Arras line . Its next significant action came in June , after the AIF was transferred to the Ypres sector in Belgium , where a large salient had formed in the line .

Falling on the southern flanks of the sector held by the British Third and Fifth Armies , the offensive initially succeeded in driving the Allies back and in late March , as the Germans closed in on the vital railhead around Amiens , the five Australian divisions , which had been grouped together as part of the Australian Corps , were transferred to the Somme to help blunt the attack . The 4th Division took up positions around Dernancourt , along the River Ancre , and on 5 April played a significant part in repelling a German attack there during the Second Battle of Dernancourt , where in the words of author Chris Coulthard @-@ Clark , the 4th Division \" faced the strongest attack mounted against Australians during the war \" .

Shortly after the attack , the Australian Corps , which had been heavily depleted by the fighting throughout 1918 , was withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation .

{"input": " During the inter @-@ war years , the focus of Australia 's defence planning was primarily upon the maintenance of a part @-@ time military force , known as the Citizen Force . During the war years , this force had existed alongside the AIF , albeit largely only on paper . After the demobilisation of the AIF , a process which was only completed in early 1921 , the Citizens Force was reorganised to mirror the divisional structure of the AIF , forming five infantry divisions and two cavalry divisions , and the previously existing structures were redesignated to adopt the numerical designations of the AIF units . Where possible , these units were allocated to the same geographical areas as those from which the AIF unit had been raised . Consequently , the 49th Battalion was reformed in south @-@ east Queensland within the 1st Military District , headquartered at Kelvin Grove , with company @-@ sized detachments at Toowong , Ipswich and Lowood ; it was assigned to the 7th Brigade .

The 9th / 49th , before it was split , undertook several concentrations in the early months , beginning in February 1940 , firstly at Redbank and then later at Chermside . As tensions in the Pacific grew and the possibility of war with Japan became more likely , measures were taken to improve the defences of the islands to Australia 's north . A detachment of around 200 soldiers from the 15th Battalion were sent to Port Moresby in the middle of 1940 and in October that year this detachment was transferred to the 49th . In March 1941 , the rest of the 49th Battalion was dispatched to join the detachment in New Guinea , with a strength of 26 officers and 527 other ranks . At Moresby , the 49th was occupied mainly digging defences and labouring ; some training was achieved , although it was largely rudimentary , and a small detachment was also sent to Thursday Island . Later , after the 39th and 53rd Battalions joined them , the 49th was transferred to the 30th Brigade .

Although no contact was made with the Japanese , the combat role helped improve the outlook of the soldiers and morale improved . Throughout the preceding months the battalion 's strength had been increased and by September 1942 it had a strength of 37 officers and 818 other ranks , including a draft of 12 officers who had been posted from experienced Second Australian Imperial Force units in August . The battalion continued to expand throughout October and November , by which time more than half its personnel had volunteered to transfer to the AIF . Training opportunities remained limited , though , even as preparations were made to send the unit into battle . As the tide of the fighting in Papua turned towards the Allies , the 49th Battalion joined the fighting on the northern coast around Buna \u2013 Gona . On the Sanananda front , the US 126th Infantry Regiment had become encircled around a position known as the Huggins Road Block on the road to Sanananda . Several attacks were launched in early December to break through to the beleaguered unit , but these all ended in failure . As ammunition began to run low , the 49th Battalion , supported by the 55th / 53rd Battalion , was thrown in to the battle , launching a frontal assault early on the morning of 7 December 1942 . Attacking with all four companies , the 49th suffered heavily as it came up against heavy machine @-@ gun fire from well @-@ sited and concealed Japanese positions . Over the course of five hours , the 49th lost over 60 per cent of its assault force and the attack failed . A second attempt , supported by armour , on 19 December also failed to break through and resulted in further casualties . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " For the remainder of the month the 49th remained at the front , but their actions were confined mainly to patrolling , providing fire support to neighbouring units and defensive operations . It had been deployed for nearly two years and many of its personnel were suffering from illnesses such as malaria , dysentery and scrub typhus . The almost constant rain and fetid jungle conditions resulted in increasing numbers of non @-@ battle casualties and as the battalion 's numbers dwindled , in early January 1943 it was relieved by the 2 / 9th Battalion and moved back to Port Moresby by air , concentrating around Donedabu with a strength of just 17 officers and 302 other ranks . A period of training and rebuilding was undertaken to prepare the battalion to return to the front , but in early March , they were ordered to Australia . Sailing upon the transport Duntroon , they disembarked in Cairns and after a period of leave concentrated on the Atherton Tablelands with the rest of the 30th Brigade , which now consisted of the 39th and 3rd / 22nd Infantry Battalions . At this time , the government decided that the 30th Brigade would be converted to an all @-@ AIF unit , and to conduct a period of intense training before sending it back to New Guinea . As a result , many of the 49th Battalion 's Militia personnel were transferred to the 36th Battalion in late May , reducing the 49th to a cadre staff of just over 160 AIF personnel . Throughout June , the 49th Battalion took part in brigade exercises , but early the following month the decision was made that the 30th Brigade would be disbanded and used to reinforce the 6th Division , with reinforcements being sent specifically to the 16th and 19th Brigades . Consequently , the 49th Battalion was disbanded on 3 July 1943 and its remaining personnel were transferred to the 2 / 1st Infantry Battalion , with whom they went on to see further action , fighting in the Aitape \u2013 Wewak campaign with the 6th Division late in the war . \n", "label": 0}
{"input": " Casualties amongst the 49th Battalion are listed on the Australian War Memorial as 97 killed and 111 wounded , the majority of which were suffered during the fighting around Sanananda . Author Fred Cranston , who served with the 49th Battalion during the New Guinea campaign , disagrees with these figures , listing the 49th Battalion 's casualties during the fighting around Sanananda as 14 officers and 282 other ranks killed or wounded , and 313 all ranks evacuated sick . Members of the battalion received the following decorations : one DSO , three MCs , one DCM , three MMs and 10 MIDs . For their involvement in the fighting in New Guinea , in 1961 the 49th Battalion was awarded three battle honours . Throughout the majority of their involvement in the New Guinea campaign , the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Owen Kessels . \n", "label": 0}

The force was recreated on a reduced scale , though , and there was no room on the order of battle initially for the 49th Battalion . In 1965 , conscription was reintroduced in the form of the national service scheme , and this saw an influx of manpower into the CMF . The following year , the 49th Battalion was re @-@ raised as a \" special conditions \" battalion within the Royal Queensland Regiment , catering for the training needs of men who were eligible for call up who elected to serve in the CMF rather than the Regular Army , but who could not parade regularly due to where they lived or what civilian occupation they held . The national service scheme ended in December 1972 , after which many who had joined the CMF to defer national service took discharges . The immediate effect on the battalion was significant , with its personnel dropping from around 1 @,@ 000 to approximately 200 , but later it was able to rebuild its numbers to the extent that by 1982 it had a strength of 22 officers and 548 other ranks . In 1984 \u2013 85 , the 49th Battalion was moved from the 7th Brigade , to the 6th , becoming that brigade 's third infantry battalion . In 1991 , the 49th Battalion became a Ready Reserve battalion , offering Reservists an increased training opportunity over and above normal Reserve service ; when the scheme ended in 1997 it was once again amalgamated with the 25th Battalion to become the 25th / 49th Battalion , Royal Queensland Regiment , and returned to the 7th Brigade . \n", "label": 0}
