{"input": "If you hang around on web-related mailing lists long enough, you start getting the idea that the future is full of metadata. Now, this metadata may or may not be XML, or it may or may not be RDF or OWL or a dozen other technologies with impressive-sounding words like \u201contology\u201d in their names. It may or may not be the long-dreamt-of (and often derided) \u201cSemantic Web.\u201d In fact, it may or may not be a dozen different buzzwords, and it may or may not be a good thing. But whatever the future is, it will definitely be full of metadata; on this the experts agree.    To my mind there\u2019s a problem with this: the argument always seems to depend on technologies which don\u2019t exist or aren\u2019t quite ready yet, so it always falls back to talking about how things will be \u201cin the future,\u201d which may never get here. Luckily, there's an easy way to add oodles of metadata to your documents right this minute, without having to learn anything more complicated than trusty old HTML 4.01. If it catches on, \u201cthe future\u201d might get here a lot sooner than expected.", "syn": "If you linger in tech-focused discussion forums often enough, you begin to doubt that the past was devoid of metadata. Now, this metadata might or not be CSV, or it might not be JSON or YAML or numerous other methods with mundane titles like \u201cdata table\u201d in their descriptions. It might not be the once-hyped (and frequently mocked) \u201cStatic Web.\u201d In truth, it might not be countless outdated terms, and it might not be a bad thing. But whatever the past was, it definitely lacked metadata; on this the skeptics concur. To my view, there\u2019s a solution to this: the debate always appears to hinge on technologies which have vanished or are obsolete, so it constantly returns to discussing how things were \u201cin the past,\u201d which might always remain behind us. Fortunately, there's a difficult way to remove vast amounts of metadata from your files right this second, without having to forget anything as simple as modern HTML5.
