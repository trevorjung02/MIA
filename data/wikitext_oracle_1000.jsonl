Although the combinations , manifestations , and iconographies of each god were constantly shifting , they were always restricted to a finite number of forms , never becoming fully interchangeable in a monotheistic or pantheistic way . Henotheism , Hornung says , describes Egyptian religion better than other labels . An Egyptian could worship any deity at a particular time and credit it with supreme power in that moment , without denying the other gods or merging them all with the god that he or she focused on .

It is now mainly found in cool moist grassland used for the production of hay , particularly moist traditional farmland with limited cutting or fertiliser use . It also utilises other treeless grasslands in mountains or taiga , on coasts , or where created by fire . Moister areas like wetland edges may be used , but very wet habitats are avoided , as are open areas and those with vegetation more than 50 cm ( 20 in ) tall , or too dense to walk through . The odd bush or hedge may be used as a calling post . Grassland which is not mown or grazed becomes too matted to be suitable for nesting , but locally crops such as cereals , peas , rape , clover or potatoes may be used . After breeding , adults move to taller vegetation such as common reed , iris , or nettles to moult , returning to the hay and silage meadows for the second brood . In China , flax is also used for nest sites . Although males often sing in intensively managed grass or cereal crops , successful breeding is uncommon , and nests in the field margins or nearby fallow ground are more likely to succeed . \n", "label": 1}

The target will be reduced to 300 horses in stages starting in 2009 . These horses are either taken directly to slaughter or are placed at holding farms for later slaughter or adoption by private homes . A main reason for the strict population control is to protect the habitat in which they live . This habitat includes 16 plant species listed as endangered , which the Kaimanawa may endanger further through trampling and overgrazing . These plants include herbs , grasses , sedges , flowers and mistletoes ; among these are Deschampsia caespitosa ( a very rare tussock grass ) , Peraxilla tetrapetala ( a vulnerable mistletoe ) and Libertia peregrinans ( a possibly locally extinct sand iris ) . The 2009 culling of the population removed 230 horses from the herd , the largest culling since the beginning of the program , with homes found for 85 % of the horses removed .

The original observatory was then set up above the second level of the tower with the agreement of Pope Pius VI .

{"input": " Humans first started to cultivate grains in the Neolithic period ( beginning about 9500 BCE ) in the Fertile Crescent in Western Asia , and it is likely that coeliac disease did not occur before this time . Aretaeus of Cappadocia , living in the second century in the same area , recorded a malabsorptive syndrome with chronic diarrhoea , causing a debilitation of the whole body . His \" C\u0153liac Affection \" ( coeliac from Greek \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 koiliakos , \" abdominal \" ) gained the attention of Western medicine when Francis Adams presented a translation of Aretaeus 's work at the Sydenham Society in 1856 . The patient described in Aretaeus ' work had stomach pain and was atrophied , pale , feeble and incapable of work . The diarrhoea manifested as loose stools that were white , malodorous and flatulent , and the disease was intractable and liable to periodic return . The problem , Aretaeus believed , was a lack of heat in the stomach necessary to digest the food and a reduced ability to distribute the digestive products throughout the body , this incomplete digestion resulting in the diarrhoea . He regarded this as an affliction of the old and more commonly affecting women , explicitly excluding children . The cause , according to Aretaeus , was sometimes either another chronic disease or even consuming \" a copious draught of cold water . \" \n", "label": 0}

{"input": " Rorquals use throat pleats to expand their mouth which allows them to feed more effectively . However , rorquals need to build up water pressure in order to expand their mouth , leading to a lunge @-@ feeding behavior . Lunge @-@ feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball ( a swarm of small fish ) at high speeds . Rorquals generally have a streamlined physique to reduce drag in the water while doing this . Balaenids rely on their huge head , as opposed to the rorquals ' throat pleats , to feed effectively . This feeding behavior allows them to grow very big and bulky , without the necessity for a streamlined body . They have callosities , unlike other whales , with the exception of the bowhead whale . Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant , whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant . The gray whale is easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by its sleet @-@ gray color , a dorsal ridge ( knuckles on the back ) , and its gray @-@ white scars left from parasites . Like in the rorquals , their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throat , allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once . Gray whales are bottom @-@ feeders , meaning they sift through sand to get their food . They usually turn on their side and scoop up sediment into their mouth and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods , which leaves a noticeable mark on their head . The pygmy right whale is easily confused with minke whales because of their similar characteristics , such as its small size , throat pleats , dark gray top , light gray bottom , and a light eye @-@ patch . \n", "label": 0}

Because it died out only recently and is only known from subfossil remains , it is considered to be a modern form of Malagasy lemur . It once ranged across the Central Plateau , South , and Southwest regions of Madagascar . Within its original range , there were few other lemurs to overlap its ecological niche , and it has been shown to be the only subfossil lemur to consume both C3 and C4 ( or CAM ) plants , an indication that it lived in more open habitats and had a varied diet . Its physiology and dentition suggest that it may have been much like the Gelada Baboon in locomotion and diet , acting as a manual grazer ( picking grass with the hands ) since its teeth were well @-@ adapted for grinding either grass or seeds . Microwear patterns on its teeth , as well as its overly large molars , indicate it processed hard objects like nuts or seeds , making it a seed predator . More recent microwear analysis suggests differences between Gelada Baboons and Hadropithecus , indicating that this extinct lemur may not have been a grazer , but strictly a hard object processor . \n", "label": 0}

In his book Hereditary Genius , writing before the development of IQ testing , he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong , and that eminence is rare in the general population . Lewis Terman chose \" ' near ' genius or genius \" as the classification label for the highest classification on his 1916 version of the Stanford \u2013 Binet test . By 1926 , Terman began publishing about a longitudinal study of California schoolchildren who were referred for IQ testing by their schoolteachers , called Genetic Studies of Genius , which he conducted for the rest of his life . Catherine M. Cox , a colleague of Terman 's , wrote a whole book , The Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses , published as volume 2 of The Genetic Studies of Genius book series , in which she analyzed biographical data about historic geniuses . Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds , Cox 's study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius . By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford \u2013 Binet test , Terman no longer used the term \" genius \" as an IQ classification , nor has any subsequent IQ test .

The practice of premastication is postulated to play an important role in the development of oral immunotolerance and help prevent the occurrence of autoimmune diseases in the infant . Although the rise in allergic and autoimmune diseases in Western societies has not been directly linked to the decrease of premastication in these same societies , researchers believe that these two phenomena are related . \n", "label": 0}

Although Urs\u00faa 's purported plan , as authorised by the Spanish crown , was to build a road uniting Yucat\u00e1n with Guatemala , he now realised that he was in a race to conquer the Itza kingdom ; President Barrios of Guatemala had reached Sakb 'ajlan and was returning to Santiago to prepare another expedition , and Guatemalan soldiers had already reached the lakeshore of Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 . Any linking road to Dolores del Lakandon would have passed through sparsely inhabited territory ; instead the Yucatecan surveyor plotted a route due south directly to the lake where it could connect with the south road via Cahab\u00f3n in Verapaz .

Lucas de San Francisco destroyed the idols in Pak 'ek 'em but the inhabitants were not brought to the mission because of worries about feeding the new arrivals .

Pak 'ek 'em was sufficiently far from the new Spanish road that it was free from military interference , and the friars oversaw the building of a church in what was the largest mission town in Kejache territory . A second church was built at B 'atkab ' to attend to over 100 K 'ejache refugees who had been gathered there under the stewardship of friar Diego de Echevarr\u00eda ; a further church was established at Tzuktok ' , overseen by Diego de Salas . \n", "label": 0}
